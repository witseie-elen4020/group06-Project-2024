Figure 8.   206Pb/238U vs 207Pb/235U concordia plot of ages (Ma) of detrital zircons from lower Roan 
Group arkose from borehole RCB2, 1467.8 m depth, in the Chambishi Basin, Zambian Copperbelt 
(sample RCB2/4) . 
 
Nguba Group-Mwashya Subgroup 
 
In the Mwashya Subgroup, the pyroclastics, mainly mafic lapilli tuffs and agglomerates of tholeiitic 
subalkaline basaltic composition, are best developed at Shituru Mine near Likasi, D. R. Congo 
(Lefebvre, 1974). An attempt was made to date zircons from these pyroclastics (sample S11), but 
they turned out to be entirely xenocrystic, with ages ranging from 3225 to 1068 Ma (Rainaud et al., 
2003). Another sample (S27-S32) of Mwashya tuff from borehole S1 (depth 104.70m to 106.50m) 
at Shituru Mine yielded three xenocrystic zircon grains with U-Pb SHRIMP ages of 1870 ± 15, 
1047 ± 25 and 983 ± 50 Ma (Table 6), reflecting inheritance from Palaeoproterozoic and Kibaran 
rocks.  
 
Nguba Group-Grand Conglomerat 
 
At Kipushi Mine, the Grand Conglomerat in the Nguba Group is intersected in borehole KHI 
1150/34/HZ-S (Tshileo et al., 2003). In this horizontal borehole, 138 m of steeply dipping 
Kakontwe carbonates overlie the >118 m thick Grand Conglomerat, which consists of massive 
diamictite with mainly small lithic clasts, between 1 and 10 mm, together with larger granitoid 
clasts up to 15 cm across, supported in an argillitic matrix. We dated a suite of detrital zircons from 
a composite sample of the Grand Conglomerat from the borehole at Kipushi Mine (sample K30-41, 
151-207 m). These detrital zircons have ages ranging from Palaeoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic 
(Table 7, Fig. 9), as follows: 1945 ± 15 to 1846 ± 22 Ma (6 zircons); and 1025 ± 86 to 822 ± 42 Ma 
(4 zircons). One zircon gave an age of 729 ± 50 Ma, but it was only 88% concordant. 
 
Biano Group 
 
Detrital muscovites from these red siltstones of the Biano Group near Gombela were dated, using 
the laser 40Ar/39Ar technique. The detrital muscovite grains were too tiny to allow for step heating, 
therefore they were analysed using single-step laser fusion. The results of laser probe spot fusion of 
seven individual detrital muscovite grains show a range of 40Ar/39Ar ages between 638.3 ± 3.9 Ma 
and 572.6 ± 4.9 Ma, with one age of 1478.8 ± 5.1 Ma (Table 8, Fig. 10). 50 detrital zircons from 
the  same  sample  (KPM3)  were dated  using  U-Pb  (SHRIMP) -  of  these,  47  ages were <±10%
