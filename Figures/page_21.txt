discordant (Table 9, Fig. 11). These ages range from 1977 ± 11 to 1780 ± 37 Ma (45 zircons) and 
1219 ± 113 to 1176 ± 62 Ma (2 zircons).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Lower Roan Subgroup 
 
Deposition of the Katanga Supergroup started at some time after 880 Ma. The ages of detrital 
zircons from the Lower Roan sediments indicate that their source region consisted mainly of 
Palaeoproterozoic rocks dated between 1790 and 2081 Ma (derived from the Palaeoproterozoic 
Lufubu Metamorphic Complex and Bangweulu Block magmatic arc terrane; Rainaud et al., 1999, 
2005), with minor contributions from some younger Mesoproterozoic to early Neoproterozoic 
rocks (c. 1300 to 900 Ma), possibly derived from the Kibaran Belt (Cahen et al., 1984; Tack et al., 
1999) and the Nchanga Granite.
