The uppermost Katangan sediments of the Biano Group in the Kundelungu Plateau consist entirely 
of red siltstones which are ripple marked, with very thin (< 1 cm) shaley interbeds. The shales show 
evidence of exposure and desiccation in the form of mudcracks, and have been reworked as 
mudchip conglomerates in rippled siltstones. Some of the ripples are flat-topped, and indicate 
modification during falling water levels. The ripples show internal cross laminations (Fig. 2), and 
they are current ripples. The polymodal palaeocurrents (based on 53 measurements on current 
ripples from 8 stations) were mainly southerly and southwesterly, with minor modes to the west-
northwest and north (Fig. 3). These siltstones are unmetamorphosed, and contain abundant detrital 
muscovites (Fig. 4), which glisten on bedding plane surfaces. The red siltstones of the Biano Group 
may correlate with the uppermost redbeds within the Luapula Beds of northwestern Zambia 
(Abraham, 1959; Thieme, 1971).
