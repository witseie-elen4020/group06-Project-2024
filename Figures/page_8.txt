Conglomeratic and arkosic sedimentary rocks at the base of the Lower Roan Subgroup of the Roan 
Group at Nchanga Mine nonconformably overlie the Nchanga Granite. Previous petrographic 
studies have indicated that there are pebbles and zircons from the Nchanga Granite in basal Roan 
conglomerates, suggesting that the lower Roan sediments are derived by erosion of a basement that 
included the Nchanga Granite (Garlick and Brummer, 1951; Binda, 1972; Garlick, 1973). A suite 
of detrital zircons from a cross-bedded Roan arkose above the contact with the Nchanga Granite, 
was extracted and dated by Armstrong et al. (2005).  U-Pb SHRIMP dating of these detrital zircons 
reveals two distinct age populations, one at around 2000 to 1800 Ma (corresponding to the age of 
the Palaeoproterozoic basement), and the other at 880 Ma (corresponding to the age of the Nchanga 
Granite) (Armstrong et al., 2005). This unequivocally proves that the Nchanga Granite provided 
detritus to the Lower Roan, and sets a firm upper limit of c. 880 Ma for the age of the Katanga 
Supergroup. 
 
The Upper Roan Subgroup is dominated by chemically precipitated and clastically reworked 
(mainly dolomitic) carbonate rocks and evaporites (anhydrite and gypsum), with few siliciclastic 
rocks. The depositional age of these rocks is poorly constrained except that they are intruded by 
numerous metagabbroic sills and dykes, which have given an age of c. 750 Ma (Armstrong et al., 
2005). Hence that is a minimum age for the Upper Roan Group. At the base of the Upper Roan 
Subgroup, the Ore Shale Member (which hosts most of the mineralization in the Zambian 
Copperbelt) is cut by microcline-bearing metamorphic veins, which were dated from two localities- 
Roan Antelope Mine (now Luanshya, Zambia) and Musoshi Mine in D.R. Congo – using the Rb-Sr 
dating technique (Cahen et al., 1970). The two results taken together were interpreted by Cahen et 
al. (1984) to give a minimum age for the Roan Group of 870 ± 42 Ma. If the Rb-Sr ages of the 
microcline veins are accepted, then the age limits for the Roan Group are as follows:- Lower Roan 
Subgroup: maximum age c. 880 Ma; minimum age 870-42 = 838 Ma; Upper Roan Subgroup: 
maximum age c. 880 Ma; minimum age c. 750 Ma. If the Rb-Sr ages of the microcline veins are 
regarded as unreliable, then the Roan Group was deposited sometime between c. 880 Ma and c. 750 
Ma.  
 
Nguba Group-Mwashya Subgroup 
 
The Mwashya Subgroup, formerly regarded as forming the top of the Roan Group (e.g., Cailteux et 
al., 2003), is now regarded as the lowermost subgroup of the Nguba Group, since it rests with an 
erosional unconformity on upper Roan Group rocks, as well as on older basement, and passes 
conformably into the Grand Conglomerat in places (Cahen, 1978; Wendorff, 2003b). It consists 
mainly of carbonates and black shales, but contains a thin pyroclastic unit with associated 
stratiform banded magnetite/haematite iron formations, which form a regional stratigraphic marker 
(Lefebvre, 1973, 1975; Cailteux et al., 2003a).  
 
In western Zambia, in the Mwinilunga area, Key and Banda (2000) have mapped a several hundred 
metres thick volcanic unit within the Mwashya Subgroup, the Lwavu Formation, which consists of 
basalts and basaltic andesites. These volcanics have been dated at 760 ± 5 Ma, utilising SHRIMP 
U-Pb dating on zircons (Armstrong, 2000; Liyungu et al., 2001; Key et al., 2001). This is the first 
accurate date for any Katangan lithological unit. Recent dating by Barron et al. (2003) of two 
gabbroic bodies in the Solwezi area, NW Zambia, yielded ages of 745 ± 7.8 Ma and 752.6 ± 8.6 
Ma, which are consistent with them being part of the extensional mafic magmatism associated with 
the Mwashya Subgroup (Kabengele et al., 2003).  
 
Nguba Group-Grand Conglomerat Formation 
 
The diamictite of the Grand Conglomerat has long been known to be a glacial tillite (Cahen, 1978). 
The evidence for a glacial origin of this diamictite rests on the common and widespread occurrence
