ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES 
 
U-Pb analyses were performed on the SHRIMP I at the Australian National University, Canberra. 
The separation of zircons was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, Johannesburg, South 
Africa, using conventional techniques. The SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is 
similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). Age calculations and plotting were done 
using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) and all ages are quoted with errors at 1σ. In the age 
interpretations, only isotopic ratios that are 10% or less discordant were considered as reliable age 
indicators. Highly discordant data were not discarded but evaluated case by case.  
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses were performed at the Australian National University, Canberra. Muscovites 
were separated at the the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, Johannesburg, South Africa and extracts were 
purified at the Australian National University. Crystals were placed into an aluminium irradiation 
canister together with interspersed aliquots of the flux monitor GA 1550 (age = 98.5 Ma; Spell and 
McDougall, 2003). Packets containing degassed potassium glass were placed at either end of the 
canister to monitor the 40Ar production from potassium (e.g., Tetley, 1980). The irradiation canister 
was irradiated for 504 hours in position X34 of the ANSTO, HIFAR reactor, Lucas Heights, New 
South Wales, Australia. The canister, which was lined with 0.2 mm Cd to absorb thermal neutrons, 
was inverted three times during the irradiation, which reduced neutron flux gradients to < 2% along 
the length of the canister. Mass discrimination was monitored by analyses of standard air volumes. 
Correction factors for interfering reactions are as follows: (40Ar/39Ar)Ca = 3.50(± 0.14)x10-4; 
(39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 7.86 (± 0.01) x 10-4 (McDougall and Harrison, 1999); (40Ar/39Ar)K = 0.050 (± 
0.005). K/Ca ratios were determined from the ANU laboratory hornblende standard 77-600 and 
were calculated as follow: K/Ca = 1.9 x 39Ar/37Ar. The reported data have been corrected for 
system blanks, mass discrimination and radioactive decay.  The calculated ages have been 
additionally corrected for reactor interferences, fluence gradients and atmospheric contamination. 
Errors associated with the age determinations are one sigma uncertainties and include errors in the 
J-value estimates. The error on the J-value is ± 0.35 %, excluding the uncertainty in the age of 
GA1550 (which is ~ 1%). Decay constants are those of Steiger and Jäger (1977).
