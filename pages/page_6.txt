PROVENANCE AGES OF THE NEOPROTEROZOIC KATANGA  
SUPERGROUP (CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT),  
WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR BASIN EVOLUTION 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co 
deposits, as well as numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe etc., which constitute the 
Central African Copperbelt in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (D.R. Congo) 
(Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961a). In spite of its great economic significance there have been, up 
to now, few age data bearing on the deposition of the Katanga Supergroup. We present here new 
SHRIMP U-Pb data on the ages of detrital zircons from Katangan sediments, as well as some 
preliminary 40Ar-39Ar data on detrital muscovites from the uppermost Katangan beds. These data 
give information on the age and likely nature of the source regions for the Katangan sediments and 
provide age constraints on upper Katangan (Biano Group) sedimentation (see Fig. 1, Table 1).

REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
In the Central African Copperbelt, the oldest pre-Katangan basement consists of a 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc sequence, comprising the Lufubu schists and intrusive granitoids, 
dated at between 1994 and 1873 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2005). Basement rocks are overlain 
unconformably by quartzitic and metapelitic metasedimentary rocks of the pre-Katangan Muva 
Group, which were deposited after 1941 Ma, based on the ages of detrital zircons (Rainaud et al., 
2003). The Nchanga Granite is the youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement (Garlick and 
Brummer, 1951; Garlick, 1973). It is an unfoliated coarse-grained peraluminous biotitic alkali
