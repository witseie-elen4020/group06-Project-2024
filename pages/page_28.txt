intrusions, similar in composition and age to the intrusions of the Luina Dome, but farther to the 
west, which are now buried under the thick pile of Katangan thrust sheets.  
 
The ages of zircons from the Grand Conglomerat at Kipushi indicate a provenance from the 
Palaeoproterozoic Ubendian basement, as well as from Kibaran granite sources and Neoprotrozoic 
sources. The age of the youngest detrital zircon would set an upper limit for the age of the Grand 
Conglomerat. In the present study, the youngest zircon is only 88% concordant, and gives an 
imprecise age of 729 ± 50 Ma. This is consistent with the age of the Grand Conglomerat being less 
than 760 ± 5 Ma (see above).  
 
Porphyritic granitoids of the Luina Dome have been dated at 1882 +23/-19 Ma (Ngoyi et al., 1991). 
These granitoids from the Luina Dome, or the younger Lufubu Schists from Kinsenda Mine on the 
flanks of the Luina Dome (which have an age of 1873 ± 8 Ma; Rainaud et al., 2005), could be the 
source of the detrital zircons in the Grand Conglomerat having ages of 1846 ± 22 Ma and 1866 ± 
18 Ma. Thus the age of detrital zircons, as well as distinctive porphyritic granite and metavolcanic 
quartz porphyry clasts, indicate that the Grand Conglomerat near Kipushi had a source region near 
the Luina Dome, in a restored pre-tectonic position about 150 to the ENE. This indicates that 
during deposition of the Grand Conglomerat, the Palaeoproterozoic rocks around the Luina Dome, 
at the northern end of the Kafue Anticline, were exposed on the surface as a basement high, just as 
they were during Roan Group deposition, since pebbles derived from the Luina and Konkola 
Domes are abundant in Lower Roan conglomerates at Musoshi, Kinsenda and Konkola mines. 
Sedimentological evidence thus indicates that the Kafue Anticline was a basement high during both 
Roan and Nguba (ex-Lower Kundelungu) Group deposition, and did not originate entirely as an 
anticlinal fold above a basement-involved frontal ramp during thick-skinned thrusting associated 
with the Lufilian Orogeny, as was proposed by Daly et al. (1984).  
 
The oldest Palaeoproterozoic detrital zircon age of 1945 ± 15 Ma from the Grand Conglomerat 
could be derived from units similar to the Samba Porphyry and associated metavolcanics, which 
have an age of 1964 ± 12 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2005). The younger group of detrital zircons, of late 
Mesoproterozoic to Neoproterozoic age could be derived from granitoids of the Kibaran Belt, 
which have ages ranging down to 1000 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984; Kokonyangi et al., 2002), and from 
granites associated with a phase of magmatic activity preceding Katangan deposition (e.g., the 880 
Ma Nchanga Granite, Armstrong et al., 2005), or the c. 843 Ma Lusaka Granite (Barr et al., 1978), 
or the 820 ± 7 Ma Ngoma Gneiss (Hanson et al., 1988, 1994). 
 
Because the Grand Conglomerat from Kipushi appears to have a different clast population from the 
rest of the Grand Conglomerat outcrops in the Lufilian arc, the ages of detrital zircons from the 
Kipushi area may not be fully representative of the provenance. For example, the quartzite pebbles 
that are so abundant in the Grand Conglomerat regionally, seem to be absent from the Kipushi 
diamictites, and so are any recycled older Palaeoproterozoic to Archaean zircons (c. 2200 to 3200 
Ma) which are present in Muva quartzite from the Zambian Copperbelt (Rainaud et al., 2003). Thus 
we suspect that if a similar study of detrital zircons were undertaken on samples of the Grand 
Conglomerat where it is typically dominated by quartzite clasts, then older recycled zircons derived 
from these quartzites will be found. 
 
According to Key et al. (2001), the ages of the volcanic units in the Nguba Group bracket the age 
of the Grand Conglomerat between 760 ± 5 and 735 ± 5 Ma. However, as noted above, the 
stratigraphic position of the younger volcanic unit is in doubt. Thus the Grand Conglomerat can 
only definitely be given a maximum age of 760 ± 5 Ma. This allows only a broad correlation of the 
Grand Conglomerat with other Neoproterozoic glacial diamictite units such as the Chuos diamictite 
in the Damara Orogen, Namibia (Hoffmann and Prave, 1996), diamictites in the Gariep and 
Saldania Belts, South Africa (Fölling and Frimmel, 2002) and the c. 750–700 Ma Sturtian
