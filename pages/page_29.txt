diamictites of the Adelaidean Supergroup, South Australia (Kaufman et al., 1997; Evans, 2000). If 
these various Neoproterozoic glaciations are part of a global “snowball earth” Sturtian glaciation, 
then they are all probably around 710 Ma in age, which is the age of two accurately dated Sturtian 
glacial diamictites, the Scout Mountain Member of the Pocatello Formation, Idaho, and the Gubrah 
Member in Oman (Fanning and Link, 2003; Hoffman et al., 2004). However, they may also be 
diachronous, spanning about 50 Ma from c. 750 to 700 Ma (Fanning and Link, 2003).  
 
Kundelungu Group-Petit Conglomerat Formation 
 
Our petrographic studies of the Petit Conglomerat are confined to samples from Kipushi Mine, 
taken from borehole KHI 1150PVSSW, at depths between 55.21 and 75.00 m. Here the Petit 
Conglomerat is 24.1 m thick, and consists of a fine-grained biotitic siltstone with a few scattered 
clasts, about 0.5 mm across, ranging up to a maximum size of 5 mm. The clasts consist of quartz 
(both mono- and polycrystalline), carbonate, shale, chert, and altered orthoclase. These clasts are 
mainly of intrabasinal derivation, with some contribution from basement granitoids (orthoclase). 
The presence in this rock of acritarchs (of planktonic origin), similar to acritarchs described from 
Kundelundu beds by Hacquaert (1931a,b,c) and Choubert (1932), indicates that the rock was 
deposited in glaciomarine conditions, rather than in a continental moraine. This fine-grained gritty 
siltstone facies of the Petit Conglomerat is a further indication of the general southward decrease in 
pebble size that has been recorded in the Petit Conglomerat, which contains much larger and more 
abundant pebbles in the north (Cahen, 1978), where it is also a lot thicker (up to 80 m in the Lukafu 
area, Vanden Brande, 1936). Cahen (1978) distinguished two facies in the Petit Conglomerat: a 
southern diamictite facies with small (<2 cm) clasts, and a northern mixed diamictite and 
conglomerate facies, with large clasts (up to 1 m granite clasts described by Grosemans, 1935) of 
varied compositions: quartz, granites, basic rocks, agates, amygdaloidal lavas, rhyolites, quartzites, 
siliceous oolites, sandstones and shales; among these, many faceted and striated clasts were 
observed (Grosemans, 1935; Vanden Brande, 1936; Batumike et al., 2002).  Many of the clasts 
originated from the adjacent Kibaran Belt to the northeast, and from the Kibambale volcanic 
complex to the north (Dumont and Cahen, 1978). In the Kapulo area of NE Katanga (28°40’–
29°40’E, 7°55’– 8°10’S), just north of Lake Mweru, a distinctive and heterogeneous suite of clast 
types (up to a maximum diameter of 30 cm) have been recorded from the Petit Conglomerat 
diamictite- these include quartzite, rhyolite, porphyries, alaskites, and rare clasts of gneiss, mica 
schists, metaconglomerates, and pisolitic black cherts (Andre, 1976; Cahen, 1978). In this case, the 
clasts are clearly derived from the adjacent Bangweulu Block to the east: rhyolites and porphyries 
from the Marungu or Luapula porphyries (Abraham, 1959; Thieme, 1971, Kabengele et al., 1987); 
alaskites from Kapulo (André, 1976); quartzites and metaconglomerates from the Mporokoso 
Group (Andersen and Unrug, 1984). Recent petrographic and geochemical studies on the Petit 
Conglomerat and other sedimentary rocks of the Nguba Group (Batumike et al., 2002, 2003) 
support the north-south facies variations, and a derivation from the Kibaran Belt and Bangweulu 
Block to the northwest and northeast of the Katangan basin.  
 
From the available radiometric data, the age of the Petit Conglomerat is not yet well constrained, 
and is only bracketed between 735 ± 5 Ma, the age of volcanics in the West Lunga Formation in the 
Nguba Group (Liyungu et al., 2001), and c. 620 Ma, the age of uraninites from veins in thrust zones 
that affect the Katangan stratigraphy to the top of the Kundelungu Group (Cahen, 1973). The Petit 
Conglomerat and its overlying cap carbonate, the Calcaire Rose, may be correlated with the Ghaub 
diamictite and Rasthof cap carbonate in the Otavi Group of the Damara Orogen, Namibia, which 
are dated at 635.5 ± 1.2 Ma (Hoffman et al., 2004).
