{"Title": "THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT ", "Authors": "L.N. GREYLING, L.J. ROBB, S. MASTER M.C. BOIRON,, Y. YAO", "Date": "November, 2004", "Abstract": "Fluid inclusions from a mineralised lateral secretion quartz vein-set in the Chambishi open pit in the Zambian Copperbelt represent fluids that immediately post-date stratiform copper mineralisation. Petrographic evidence indicates that this vein set predates deformation in the area. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy of aqueous and aqueo- carbonic inclusions indicate the presence of an early saline H2O-NaCl+MgCl2\u00b1CaCl2\u00b1CO2 \u00b1CH4 \u00b1N2 fluid (11.9-23.1 wt.% NaClequiv) at homogenisation temperatures of 86-129\u00b0C. Later fluids occur in fluid inclusion planes and are linked to early metamorphism of the basin. These fluids are more varied in composition and are aqueous, aqueo-carbonic, and pure methane inclusions. Aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions are H2O-NaCl \u00b1CaCl2 \u00b1MgCl2 \u00b1KCl \u00b1CO2, N2, CH4, H2S fluids, with two salinity end-members, namely, a high salinity (18- 23 wt.% NaClequiv) - lower temperature (~130-160\u00b0C) fluid, and a lower salinity (~6 wt.% NaClequiv) - higher temperature (~140-210 \u00b0C) fluid. Later carbonic inclusion planes contain CH4, with N2 and C2H6. Later fluids are complex in composition, salinity, and homogenisation temperatures and are thought to be late-diagenetic on the one hand, and early (methane productive) metamorphic on the other. Pressure and temperature conditions in the environment immediately after stratiform copper mineralisation occurred were around 480- 800 bar and 130-270 \u00b0C.\n", "File": "data/385.pdf"}
