Figure 4. Generalised stratigraphy of the Upper Devonian and Lower Carboniferous of the Irish Midlands (after Andrew, 1993). Dates for these various subdivisions vary in the literature, those on the right are from Harland et al. (1990) while those on the left, in italics, are from Andrew (1993). The most recent dates for Devonian rocks from the UK and Australia, shown in brackets, are based on single zircon SHRIMP dating by Compston (2000).		PDF_page:13		DOC_page:7

Figure 7. Map showing significant lead-zinc deposits of the Irish Midlands in both Carboniferous carbonates and basement hosts. The major producing mines given in Table 4 are named. The position of the Variscan Front is based on recent seismic evidence given in Masson et al. (1998).		PDF_page:21		DOC_page:15
Figure 11. Map showing the regional location of Ross Island, Muckross and Crow Island. Inset shows the simplified regional geology. Abbreviations used are: B.P.F., Benson’s Point Fault; K.M.F., Killarney-Mallow Fault; and B.L.F., Black Lake Fault (after Ford et al., 1991; Meere 1995a).		PDF_page:27		DOC_page:21

Figure 14. Sketch of a moderately open fold with a shallow-dipping south limb and a steeply dipping overturned northern limb. Inset A shows how the cleavage is refracted between the limestone and a shale horizon. Inset B shows the development of lensoidal structures oblique to bedding in shale and chert layers.

Figure 17. Logs of the seven borehole cores from Ross Island showing variation in the veining and fabric within the two lithologies, Ballysteen limestone occurs above and Rockfield limestone occurs below the thrust plane. The thrust plane is shown by a thick line with depths to thrust plane shown to the right of the column. However, although actually shown as a horizontal line in the diagram for simplicity, note that the thrust plane in each core is parallel to the veining and structural fabric. Other figures to the right of the column are the percentage of carbonate veins. Length of core is indicated by numbers below the log in metres. The location of these cores is shown on Figure 12.

Diagram showing the possible evolution of the Ross Island thrust: (a) asymmetric folding with extension on fold limbs; (b) development of calcite boxwork veining; and (c) shearing of the fold limb with localised extension, attenuation of calcite veins, and the formation of a ductile thrust (Nex et al., 2001).

Lead-isotope data for Red Bed-hosted copper mineralisation in southwest Ireland, showing the spread of data for the disseminated ores, and more tightly constrained data for ores from the minor and major quartz veins: (a) 206Pb/204Pb v 207Pb/204Pb; and (b) 206Pb/204Pb v 208Pb/204Pb (data from Rohl and Needham, 1998).

Figure 27. Combined lead-isotope data for Red Bed-hosted copper deposits of southwest Ireland, the Carboniferous-hosted stratabound ores (Blue Hole and Muckross) and vein-type ores (Western Mine). Lead from the southeast basement and northern basement are shown in symbols, whilst the data for the Carboniferous-hosted lead-zinc deposits given in Figure 19(a) is illustrated as a field. A mixing line is shown for the Red Bed-hosted deposits, between a high-radiogenic granitic source, and a source that is similar to that of the Carboniferous lead-zinc deposits (data from O’Keeffe, 1986; Duane, 1988; Rohl and Needham, 1998).

Figure 28. Lead-isotope data for the Carboniferous-hosted stratabound copper-silver-lead-zinc mineralisation of Muckross and Blue Hole and for the vein mineralisation at Western Mine. Isochrons are drawn on the 206Pb/204Pb v 207Pb/204Pb plot indicating that the Muckross mineralisation is slightly older than other deposits, and that the veins of Western Mine are a younger event (data from Rohl and Needham, 1998).
