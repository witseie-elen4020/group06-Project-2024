Figure1: General geology of the Central African Copperbelt, showing the location of the Chambishi deposit in Zambia (modified from François, 1974 and Rainaud et al., 2003).		PDF_page:5		DOC_page:1
Figure 2: Cross section of the Chambishi Main deposit (after Garlick, 1961), showing an asymmetrical fold in the now abandoned open pit. Regional thrusting occurred to the northeast as a result of compression during the Pan African Lufilian orogeny. The location of the samples for this study is indicated in the Ore Shale horizon.

Figure 3: Lateral secretion of primary copper mineralisation from the surrounding shale into a quartz vein, leaving a halo, depleted of mineralisation, surrounding the quartz vein in the Ore Shale horizon (A). The axial planar cleavage (B), produced during folding of the Ore Shale, is refracted by the intruding vein (C), which shows that the introduction of the vein preceded folding of the strata, but post-dated the stratiform mineralisation.

A: Isolated aqueous fluid inclusions (sample CBS-qz8A[1]9) B: Isolated aqueous fluid inclusions (sample CBS-qz8A[1]2) C: Secondary fluid inclusion planes (FIP’s) of aqueous inclusions (CBS-qz3A[4]) D: Isolated aqueo-carbonic inclusions (CBS-qz8A[1]3) E: FIP’s aqueo-carbonic inclusion (CBS-qz3By[4]1) F-G: Secondary aqueo-carbonic trail fluid inclusions trail(CBS-qz6A[2]) H-I: Isolated aqueo-carbonic inclusion with negative crystal shape (CBS-qz3A[6]10) J-L: Secondary methane inclusions preserved in fluid inclusion planes (CBS-qz7BA[1]4).

Figure 5: A: Histogram showing the distribution of the final ice melting temperatures (Tmice) of aqueous isolated (primary) and trail (secondary) inclusions. B: Histogram showing the final homogenisation temperature (Tht in °C) distribution of all aqueous and aqueous carbonic inclusions.		PDF_page:14		DOC_page:10
Figure 6: A: Histogram of melting of CO2 temperatures (TmCO2) for all aqueous (aq) and aqueo-carbonic (aq-car) inclusions. B: The distribution in temperatures of CO2 homogenisation for all aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions (ThCO2). Homogenisation was to the liquid phase. C: Distribution of homogenisation temperatures (ThCH4) methane inclusions in fluid inclusion planes. Homogenisation for all inclusions was to the liquid phase.		PDF_page:15		DOC_page:11
Figure 7: A: Frequency vs salinity (wt.% NaClequiv) for all aqueous and aqueous-carbonic inclusions from isolated and trail populations show a large spread. B: Salinity (expressed in wt.% NaClequiv) vs homogenisation temperatures (Tht) to the liquid phase for primary (black diamonds) and secondary (white squares) aqueous inclusions. Secondary fluid inclusions show two groups in terms of salinity, namely a low-salinity (~6 wt.% NaClequiv) higher temperature (~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% NaClequiv) lower temperature (~130- 160°C) group.

Figure 8: Isochors of primary and secondary aqueous inclusions and methane FIP’s. Isochors of primary aqueous inclusions are indicated as dashed lines. Isochors for high salinity FIP’s are shown as solid black lines, and sold grey lines for low salinity FIPs. Isochors of methane FIP’s are shown as gently sloping solid black lines. Intersection of the aqueous and carbonic (methane) isochors constrain a P-T region of ~480-800 bar and ~130-270°C. Previous studies by Richards et al., (1988a) Speiser et al., (1995), and Kamona (1993) are shown. See text for further details.		PDF_page:18		DOC_page:14
