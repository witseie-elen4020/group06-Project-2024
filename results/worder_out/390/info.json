{"Title": "PROVENANCE AGES OF THE NEOPROTEROZOIC KATANGA SUPERGROUP (CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT), WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR BASIN EVOLUTION", "Authors": "S. MASTER, C. RAINAUD, R. A. ARMSTRONG, D. PHILLIPS, L. J. ROBB", "Date": "August 2005", "Abstract": "New age data on detrital zircons and micas are presented from key units within the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup, which hosts the major stratiform Cu-Co deposits of the Central African Copperbelt. Detrital zircon ages indicate a mainly Palaeoproterozoic (between 2081 \u00b1 28 to 1836 \u00b1 26 Ma) provenance for the Katanga basin, derived from the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Kafue Anticline and the Bangweulu Block to the north of the outcrop belt. Detrital zircons and clasts from the Grand Conglomerat glacial diamictite indicate a source from the Palaeoproterozoic metavolcanic porphyries and granitoids of Luina Dome region, which was a basement high during Nguba Group deposition. Minor zircons of Mesoproterozoic age may have been derived from the Kibaran belt. Finally, 40Ar/39Ar age data from detrital muscovites from Biano Group siltstones give a maximum age of sedimentation of 573 Ma, strongly supporting previous models that the Biano Group was deposited in a foreland basin of the Lufilian Orogen.\n", "File": "data/390.pdf"}
