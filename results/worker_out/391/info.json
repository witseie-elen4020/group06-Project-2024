{"Title": "MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING THE PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY", "Authors": "C. RAINAUD, S. MASTER, R. A. ARMSTRONG, D. PHILLIPS, L. J. ROBB", "Date": "August, 2005", "Abstract": " New SHRIMP U-Pb age data on metamorphic monazite, as well as step-heating 40Ar-39Ar ages on metamorphic biotite, muscovite and microcline, from Katangan metasedimentary rocks of the Central African Copperbelt are presented. These rocks were deformed and metamorphosed during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. Three samples of metamorphic monazite from the Chambishi structural basin give ages of 592 \u00b1 22 Ma, 531 \u00b1 12 Ma and 512 \u00b1 17 Ma, which correspond respectively to the ages of eclogite facies metamorphism, high pressure talc-kyanite whiteschist metamorphism, and of a regional metamorphism/ mineralisation pulse elsewhere within the Lufilian Orogen. A biotite population from Luanshya gives a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 586.1 \u00b1 1.7 Ma, coinciding with the oldest monazite age. Several samples from the Chambishi basin and the Konkola area give 40Ar/39Ar biotite plateau ages in the range of 496.6 \u00b1 0.6 to 485.2 \u00b1 0.9 Ma, and a muscovite plateau age of 483.6 \u00b1 1.1 Ma, which are a manifestation of regional uplift and cooling that affected the whole Katangan basin. The youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 \u00b1 2.7 Ma to 405.8 \u00b1 3.8 Ma, reflecting continued slow cooling of the Lufilian Orogen.\n", "File": "data/391.pdf"}
