{"Title": "POLYMETALLIC COPPER AND ZINC-LEAD MINERALISATION IN SOUTHERN IRELAND - WITH EMPHASIS ON THE ROSS ISLAND AND MUCKROSS DEPOSITS NEAR KILLARNEY, SOUTHWEST IRELAND", "Authors": "JUDITH A. KINNAIRD and PAUL A. M. NEX", "Date": "December, 2004", "Abstract": "Lead isotope studies have been undertaken on the economically important Zn-Pb deposits of central Ireland but there are few data for low-grade, Cu-dominated, Red Bed-hosted deposits of southwest County Cork, or the minor carbonate-hosted Courceyan Cu-polymetallic deposits in the southwest of Ireland. The origin of lead and other metals in the Carboniferous carbonate-hosted base metal deposits of the Irish Midlands is regarded as the underlying Caledonian basement. Published isotopic data show a very restricted range for any particular deposit, a linear trend of data on the 206Pb/204Pb v 207Pb/204Pb plot and a systematic geographical variation of 206Pb/204Pb data in Carboniferous Zn-Pb deposits, becoming more radiogenic from northeast to southwest irrespective of mineralisation style, age or host. These trends are attributed to mixing of lead derived from an old non-radiogenic northwest source and a more radiogenic southeast source.\nDevonian Red Bed-hosted deposits in the Munster Basin occur either as low-grade stratiform disseminated bornite and djurleite and minor veinlets, as at Mt. Gabriel, or as major quartz veins with copper-dominated polymetallic deposits, as at Allihies, Dhurode and Ballycummisk. Lead- isotopic ratios vary according to the style of mineralisation. For disseminated sulphides, there is a considerable scatter of data on both 206Pb/204Pb v 207Pb/204Pb and on 206Pb/204Pb v 208Pb/204Pb plots, especially for Mt. Gabriel. They appear to define a mixing line between a basement source and a more radiogenic component, which may have been granite-derived detrital minerals in the Red Beds. For the minor veinlets there is a more restricted distribution of lead-isotopic data, which could be interpreted in terms of fluid flow homogenising the wide spread of Pb-isotope ratios from the disseminated sulphides. This is consistent with published sulphur-isotope data. The major quartz veins show a clustered array of isotopic ratios and it is suggested that the bulk of the metals were derived from a basement source with a minor contribution from Red Beds. In these deposits remobilised disseminated ores were deposited along spaced cleavages and minor veinlets and major sulphide-bearing veins formed after folding during continued Variscan compression\nThe Courceyan carbonate-hosted Cu-Ag deposits form three groups: (1) Cu-Ag \u00b1 Hg-As-Sb-U epigenetic vein-hosted deposits, as at Gortdrum; (2) Cu-As \u00b1 Zn, Pb, Ag, Co, Ni stratabound deposits characterised by chalcopyrite-pyrite or, sphalerite-galena, both with sulpharsenides and tennantite, as at Muckross, Crow Island and Blue Hole on Ross Island; and (3) Cu-As \u00b1 Pb, Ag, Mo, Co, Ni epigenetic vein deposits characterised by chalcopyrite-tennantite veins at Western Mine on Ross Island and Ardtully. Lead-isotope data for the stratabound deposits show a very restricted range of compositions for each locality and plot close to the same mixing line as the Carboniferous Zn-Pb deposits, but towards the end-member defined by the southeast basement source. These plots suggest that lead has been derived from a basement source similar to the Zn-Pb of the Irish Midlands. Their model age of 350 Ma \u00b1 10 Ma for stratabound mineralisation is close to that of their host rocks. Lead-isotope data for the epigenetic Cu-As vein deposits at Western Mine suggest a similar source, but a younger age of 280 \u00b1 10 Ma for mineralisation. This 280 \u00b1 10 Ma age has important implications for the timing of the Variscan orogeny in southwest Ireland. Chalcopyrite-tennantite mineralisation that partly lies along pressure-solution cleavage planes, developed prior to major folding and thrusting. The thrusting episode that emplaced the mineralised tectonic sheet of Ross Island west of Killarney must, therefore, postdate c. 280 Ma, as the pressure-solution cleavage was deformed by the thrusting.\nThere appears to be a temporal relationship between stratabound Cu-polymetallic deposits in southwest Ireland, which formed during Carboniferous basin extension and the Zn-Pb deposits of the Irish Midlands. The difference in the ore assemblage between the two areas may be due to copper derivation from Red Beds in the southwest where the carbonates that host the stratabound Cu- polymetallic deposits are underlain by up to 6 km of Red Beds. In the Midlands, the Zn-Pb ore- bearing carbonates are underlain by lower Palaeozoic greywackes with a minimal thickness of late Devonian Red Beds. It is only for Ardtully that the isotopic evidence indicates a major source of metals from within Red Beds. For Ross Island, Crow Island and Muckross, unless the metals in the Red Beds originated from a basement rather than a granite source, a significant Red Bed contribution to the metals seems unlikely. An alternative possibility is that the Palaeozoic basement in the southwest, from which the carbonate-hosted copper ores were derived, was more copper rich than that beneath the Irish Midlands, perhaps derived from the continuation of Ordovician island-arc volcanics in southeast Ireland beneath the cover of the Munster Basin.\n", "File": "data/386.pdf"}
