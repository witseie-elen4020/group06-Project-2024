Table 2a. Descriptive details of the host rock lithology, and ore mineralogy of selected deposits hosted by Devonian Red Beds. Locations of the ore deposits are shown in Figure 5. The Formation names below the table are in stratigraphic order with the Caha Mountain Formation being the oldest (data from Ni Wen et al., 1996; 1999; Snodin, 1972; Jackson, 1980; Reilly, 1986); for composition of minerals see Table 3		PDF_page:17		DOC_page:11
Table 2b. Stratigraphic correlation of ORS Formations between the Toe Head area on the southern basin margin and the Beara-Bantry area close to the depocentre. Superscripts denote different deposits Dh = Dhurode, Ca = Cappaghglass, Bal = Ballycummisk, Der = Derrycarhoon, Bar = Ballyrisode, Al = Allihies. Data are from Williams et al. (1989), Pracht (1997) and Pracht (pers. comm.)		PDF_page:18		DOC_page:12

Table 6 Descriptive details of the carbonate-hosted copper-polymetallic deposits in the Munster / Shannon Basin. Host rock lithology is Courceyan Ballysteen Limestone, the lateral equivalent of the Argillaceous Bioclastic Limestone in the Irish Midlands.
