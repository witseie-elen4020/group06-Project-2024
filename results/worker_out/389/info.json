The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc- alkaline volcanic arc sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yield ages of 1980 \u00b1 7, 1968 \u00b1 9, 1964 \u00b1 12 and 1874 \u00b1 8 Ma. The oldest dated unit from the region, the Mkushi granitic gneiss from southeast of the Zambian Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 \u00b1 6 Ma. The copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut the foliation in the Mkushi Gneisses, have mainly xenocrystic, zoned zircons with cores dated at c. 2070\u20132000 Ma. Overgrowths on these cores are dated at 1059 \u00b1 26 Ma, which is interpreted as the intrusive age of the aplites. An augen gneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge locality yielded an emplacement age of 1976 \u00b1 5 Ma. The Mufulira Pink Granite has an age of 1994 \u00b1 7 Ma, while the Chambishi Granite has been dated at 1983 \u00b1 5 Ma, an age within error of Lufubu schist metavolcanics from elsewhere in the Chambishi basin. The gneisses, granitoids and acid-intermediate, calc-alkaline metavolcanics are considered to represent stages in the evolution of one or more magmatic arcs that formed episodically over a 200 million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. We suggest naming this assemblage of rocks the \u201cLufubu Metamorphic Complex\u201d. The rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex are interpreted to be part of a regionally extensive Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and the DRC. This terrane is termed the Kamanjab-Bangweulu arc and is inferred to have collided with the Archaean Tanzanian Craton during the c. 2000\u20131900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new composite minicontinental entity that we term the \u201cKambantan\u201d terrane. The Kambantan terrane was accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the c. 1400\u20131000 Ma Kibaran Orogeny.\n", "File": "data/389.pdf"}
