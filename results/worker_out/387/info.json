{"Title": "ON THE ORIGIN OF ARCHAEAN CARBONACEOUS CHERTS AS DEDUCED FROM FIELD OBSERVATIONS IN THE BARBERTON GREENSTONE BELT, SOUTH AFRICA", "Authors": "AXEL HOFMANN", "Date": "January, 2005", "Abstract": "he 3500-3200 Ma old volcano-sedimentary succession of the Barberton greenstone belt, South Africa, is characterized by lithological units that are repeated in a regular manner. Ultramafic to dacitic volcanic and volcaniclastic sequences are typically capped by zones of silica enrichment, followed by beds of sedimentary cherts that are rich in carbonaceous matter. Cross-cutting carbonaceous chert dykes and veins are common in silica alteration zones and bedded cherts. A detailed field study of several chert horizons covering most of the stratigraphic succession of the Barberton belt revealed the importance of syndepositional hydrothermal activity for their origin. Bedded cherts consist of silicified sedimentary and tuffaceous material that was deposited on the seafloor. Silicification took place at the sediment-water interface, as a result of diffuse upflow of low-temperature hydrothermal fluids. This resulted in the formation of cap rocks impermeable for ascending hydrothermal fluids. Fluid overpressure resulted in the breaching of the cap rocks at times. Chert dykes contain angular host rock fragments, replace wall rocks, and show evidence of multiple dyke fillings and in situ brecciation of earlier generations of dyke fillings. They represent hydraulic fractures that were initiated by overpressuring of the hydrothermal system. The resulting vein networks, in both volcanic and sedimentary rocks, were then infilled, partly by hydrothermal chert precipitates, and partly by still unconsolidated sedimentary material derived from overlying sedimentary horizons. Most carbonaceous matter represents sedimentary material and did not form by hydrothermal processes, which supports a biogenic origin.\n", "File": "data/387.pdf"}
