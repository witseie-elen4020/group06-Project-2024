THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
ABSTRACT 
 
Fluid inclusions from a mineralised lateral secretion quartz vein-set in the Chambishi open pit 
in the Zambian Copperbelt represent fluids that immediately post-date stratiform copper 
mineralisation. Petrographic evidence indicates that this vein set predates deformation in the 
area. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy of aqueous and aqueo-
carbonic inclusions indicate the presence of an early saline H2O-NaCl+MgCl2±CaCl2±CO2 
±CH4 ±N2 fluid (11.9-23.1 wt.% NaClequiv) at homogenisation temperatures of 86-129°C. 
Later fluids occur in fluid inclusion planes and are linked to early metamorphism of the basin. 
These fluids are more varied in composition and are aqueous, aqueo-carbonic, and pure 
methane inclusions. Aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions are H2O-NaCl ±CaCl2 ±MgCl2 
±KCl ±CO2, N2, CH4, H2S fluids, with two salinity end-members, namely, a high salinity (18-
23 wt.% NaClequiv) - lower temperature (~130-160°C) fluid, and a lower salinity (~6 wt.% 
NaClequiv) - higher temperature (~140-210 °C) fluid. Later carbonic inclusion planes contain 
CH4, with N2 and C2H6. Later fluids are complex in composition, salinity, and 
homogenisation temperatures and are thought to be late-diagenetic on the one hand, and early 
(methane productive) metamorphic on the other. Pressure and temperature conditions in the 
environment immediately after stratiform copper mineralisation occurred were around 480-
800 bar and 130-270 °C.

THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Neoproterozoic stratiform Cu-Co ores of the Central African Copperbelt are hosted mainly 
by the Roan Group at the base of the Katanga Supergroup. This metallogenic province is situated 
on the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and is 
preserved in the Lufulian Arc (Fig. 1). Theories on the origin of mineralisation of these 
sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits have ranged from syngenetic (Garlick, 1961; 
Fleischer, 1984; Sweeney and Binda, 1994) to epigenetic (Jackson, 1932; McGowan et al., 
2003). However, recent models of ore deposition favour either early- or late diagenesis (Robb, 
2005). In addition, the presence of a variety of epigenetic ores such as the Cu-Au, U- (Cu-Co-
Ni-Mo), and Zn-Pb-Cu-Ge-Ga deposits within the Katanga metallogenic province illustrates the 
scale and complexity of mineralisation styles. Therefore, regional metallogenesis is best viewed 
in a polygenetic framework. This paper describes the fluid inclusion character of quartz veins 
from the Chambishi deposit (Figs. 1, 2). This forms part of a regional fluid study aimed at 
deciphering and documenting the characteristics and evolution of early fluids (late diagenetic), 
possibly associated with mineralisation, and late fluids (trapped during regional metamorphism 
post-dating stratiform mineralisation).

as a result of compression during the Pan African Lufilian orogeny. The location of the samples 
for this study is indicated in the Ore Shale horizon. 
 
GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The stratiform copper deposits of the Central African Copperbelt are hosted by the meta-
sediments of the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup (Fig. 1). The Katanga Supergroup 
unconformably overlies a basement comprised of an exposed Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline 
volcanic arc terrane (Rainaud et al., 1999), which in turn overlies a Mesoarchaean terrane 
(Rainaud et al., 2003). This basement is intruded by granitoids, which constrains the maximum 
age of Katangan sedimentation (Armstrong et al., 1999). The Katanga succession in Zambia is 
composed of the Roan, Mwashya, Nguba, and Kundelungu Groups, as specified by Wendorff 
(2003). Sedimentation of the Katanga occurred between 880 Ma (Armstrong et al., 1999) and 
620 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984), with the onset of the Roan Group arenites, argillites, and shales 
deposited during rifting (Wendorff, 2003). According to Wendorff (2003), the Roan Group is 
overlain by the Mwashya Group, unconformably in the Kafue anticline region in Zambia, and 
non-conformably on the pre-Katanga basement in the DRC. Two tillites are present in the Nguba 
Group, which is comprised of marine siliciclastics and carbonate rocks. The base of the Nguba 
Group is indicated by the first tillite, the so-called Grand Conglomérat, which probably 
corresponds to the Sturtian glaciation (Robb et al., 2002; Robb, 2005). 
 
The Katanga sediments were metamorphosed during the Lufilian orogenic event at c. 600-500 
Ma (John et al., 2002) to greenschist facies in the Zambian Copperbelt, and to amphibolite facies 
in the Solwezi area to the west of the Copperbelt, with a general decrease in grade to the 
northeast, towards the DRC (Mendelsohn, 1961a). The Katanga metasediments are preserved in 
several structural basins (e.g., Konkola, Chambishi, Roan). 
 
 
 
REGIONAL STRATIFORM COPPER MINERALISATION 
 
Mineralisation in Zambia and the DRC is mainly hosted in the lower Roan Group, but minor 
occurrences of mineralisation are also found in the basement and in the dolomites of the Nguba 
 
2

--- Page 6 ---
Group. Ore minerals are mostly sulphides (including bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite, carrollite, 
and pyrite), and secondary oxides. Mineralisation in the lower Roan Group is hosted in two 
lithologies, namely, argillaceous shales and arenaceous quartzites and arkoses. Generally, the 
deposits of the Ore Shale (Fig. 2) are located along the west of the Kafue anticline (Fig. 1). The 
Ore Shale consists mostly of silty, micaceous (biotite or sericite ± muscovite), calcareous grains, 
with quartz, feldspar, carbonate, Cu-Fe sulphides, chlorite and organic carbon. The thickness 
varies from 5-20 m, and sulphides are generally disseminated through the Ore Shale, with 
concentrations along bedding planes (Mendelsohn, 1961b). The sericitic quartzite-hosted 
deposits are found along the eastern flank of the Kafue anticline in the Mufulira area (Fig. 1). 
 
PREVIOUS FLUID INCLUSION STUDIES: ZAMBIA AND THE DRC 
 
Previous fluid inclusion studies in Zambia and the DRC include work by Pirmolin (1970), 
Sweeney (1987), Richards et al. (1988a), Speiser et al. (1995), and Kamona (1993). A summary 
of the main results is presented in Table 1, with the section below outlining the main findings of 
each of these studies. 
 
• Pirmolin (1970) described fluid inclusions from an unmineralised cherty dolomite layer of 
the Mines Group of the Roan Group at Kamoto in the DRC, and concluded that the solutions 
in this area reached temperatures of ~200°C at salinities of ~40 wt. % NaClequiv . 
• Crosscutting quartz veins at the Konkola and Chambishi Cu-Co deposits were studied by 
Sweeney (1987). These veins had undergone at least one post-formational tectono-thermal 
event. Scanning electron microscopy of decrepitated inclusion cavities showed the presence 
of Na, Al, Si, S, U, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Co, and KCl, NaCl daughter minerals. Gas analyses 
of decrepitated inclusions revealed the presence of CO2, CH4, and N2. It was concluded that 
the veins formed by lateral migration of fluids during late diagenetic dewatering. 
• Richards et al. (1988a) indicated the presence of a sylvite-halite-saturated fluid in quartz-
hematite-rutile veins hosted in the footwall sediments of the Musoshi copper deposit (DRC), 
where late hydrothermal veining caused extensive footwall- and Ore Shale- alteration. Fluid 
inclusions were found to consist of NaCl, KCl ± CO2. This hydrothermal event postdates 
stratiform copper mineralisation and is linked to compressional deformation and 
metamorphism during the Lufilian orogeny. They estimated the maximum homogenisation 
pressure at 1.2 kbar, which is the typical pressure for decrepitation of 12-13µm size fluid 
inclusions in quartz (Leroy, 1979). 
• Epigenetic iron-oxide-Cu-Au type mineralisation at the Kansanshi Copper Mine (Solwezi 
area, northwestern Zambia) was studied by Speiser et al. (1995) and Speiser (1994). 
Hydrothermal veining at Kansanshi is connected with alteration of the host rocks, and 
mineralised (Cu-Mo-Fe) veins have been dated at ~503-511 Ma (Re-Os and U-Pb of 
molybdenite and monazite) by Torrealday et al. (1999). Mineralisation at the Kansanshi 
Mine may also correspond to mineralisation at the Shinkwelobwe Mine (Cu-U), which is 
dated at 602 Ma (U/Pb, Cahen and Snelling, 1984). This style of mineralisation post-dated 
host-rock metamorphism. 
• Kamona (1993) studied fluids from the epigenetic stratabound carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn 
Kabwe deposit, central Zambia. This epigenetic deposit is hosted by the Kabwe Dolomite 
Formation, where mineralising fluids were saline, ranging between 11-31 wt.% NaClequiv, 
and Th ranged between 257 and 305°C, corresponding to ore deposition at 320°C. 
• Kampunzu et al. (1998) reported fluid inclusions from the epigenetic sediment-hosted Pb-Zn 
Kipushi deposit with high homogenisation temperatures (300°C) as temperatures of 
mineralising fluids. This style of mineralisation post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation.

The work of Pirmolin (1970) and Sweeney (1987) is relevant to the present study. Their data 
indicate that fluids circulated early during the basin evolution, and were saline with moderate 
homogenisation temperatures. The present study, however, provides information on a vein set in 
a mineralised setting, where the tectonic and paragenetic relationships are better constrained. 
Accordingly, this study will add to existing knowledge of early tectonic fluids.  
 
 
CHAMBISHI COPPER DEPOSIT 
 
Two deposits are identified in the Chambishi area, namely the Chambishi Main and the 
Chambishi West orebodies (Garlick, 1961; Garlick, 1976), where the Katanga metasediments 
unconformably overlie the 2050-1850 Ma basement comprising granitoids and the Lufubu 
schists (Master et al., 2004; Rainaud et al., 2004). The Katanga metasediments are preserved 
along the northern rim of the Chambishi-Nkana basin, striking east-west, and dipping south at 
about 60° (Garlick, 1961). The Ore Shale in this area consists of carbonaceous shale, siltstone, 
argillite, and interbedded dolomite (Fig. 2). Disseminated copper (± cobalt) sulphide 
mineralisation is present within the Ore Shale of the lower Roan Group (Fleischer, 1984). 
Zonation of chalcopyrite-bornite-chalcocite is present in the Ore Shale. The barren shale 
overlying the Ore Shale is mineralised with disseminated pyrite. Secondary malachite occurs as 
an oxidation product of primary sulphides. 
 
Copper mineralisation in the Ore Shale was followed by the formation of bedding parallel quartz 
veins. Figure 3A illustrates a depleted halo surrounding a quartz vein where copper sulphides 
have been remobilized from the shale into the quartz vein. The mineralised sediments were 
subsequently metamorphosed and folded resulting in the development of an axial planar 
cleavage (Fig. 3B). This cleavage is refracted through the quartz vein (Fig. 3C), indicating a 
process of lateral secretion prior to metamorphism (see Fig. 3D).

Figure 3: Lateral secretion of primary copper mineralisation from the surrounding shale into a 
quartz vein, leaving a halo, depleted of mineralisation, surrounding the quartz vein in the Ore 
Shale horizon (A). The axial planar cleavage (B), produced during folding of the Ore Shale, is 
refracted by the intruding vein (C), which shows that the introduction of the vein preceded 
folding of the strata, but post-dated the stratiform mineralisation.  
 
CHAMBISHI FLUID INCLUSIONS 
 
Sample selection 
 
Samples were selected from the quartz vein hosted in the Ore Shale Formation illustrated in 
Figure 3. The early pre-orogenic tectonic setting of this particular vein is indicated by the axial 
planar cleavage, which is refracted from the shale through the quartz vein. 
 
Petrography 
 
Certain minerals host fluid inclusions, which become trapped either during, or subsequent to, 
crystal growth (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The relationship between individual inclusions, 
and amongst inclusions and growth zones, indicates the relative timing of entrapment. Based on 
petrographic observations, fluid inclusions and fluid inclusion assemblages may be identified as 
primary, secondary, or pseudo-secondary (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). 
Assuming that no leaking or resetting has occurred during metamorphism in the Chambishi 
basin, primary inclusions found in this setting are interpreted as representative of pre-
metamorphic fluids. Conversely, pseudo-secondary and secondary inclusions will be distinctive 
of fluids present during (and to some extent after) metamorphism.  
 
In this study double-polished quartz wafers showed no growth zonation during optical 
microscopy or cathodoluminescence. However, a few small (<10µm), isolated inclusions are 
interpreted to be of primary origin based on their isolated distribution among secondary fluid 
inclusion planes (FIP’s) (Fig. 4 D, E, H, I). These inclusions are interpreted to be representative 
of post-mineralising, pre-metamorphic  fluids. Secondary fluid inclusions form when fluid is 
trapped during healing of microcracks, shear planes, or along twin planes or cleavage directions 
after crystal formation (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The majority of inclusions documented 
here are interpreted as secondary. Therefore, inclusions in trails and fluid inclusion planes have 
trapped later fluids that also post-date mineralisation, but are coeval with deformation (Fig. 4 A-
C, G, J-L). This study reports the characteristics of fluids trapped subsequent to mineralisation, 
and coeval with deformation of the Chambishi basin.

Methodology 
 
Double polished wafers of ~200 µm thickness were used for the petrographic and 
microthermometric study. Microthermometry was performed on a Linkam TH600 stage 
connected to an Olympus Vanox binocular microscope. The accuracy of the measurements was 
of ± 0.1°C at low temperatures and ± 2°C at high temperatures. Inclusions were cooled to -
170°C and phase transitions were measured during heating. Estimates of the volumes of volatile 
phases at room temperature was undertaken using the volumetric estimation chart of Roedder 
(1972). The gaseous molar fractions were determined using a Raman Labram Jobin-Yvon 
microspectrometer, with an ionised Ar laser (wavelength 514.5 nm) as excitation source. The 
laser was focused on the sample with an 80x objective lens. 
 
Fluid inclusion types are defined according to the nomenclature used by Boiron et al. (1992). 
Inclusions are classified based on their final homogenisation (Tht) behaviour (see Table 2), L: 
into the liquid phase, V: into the vapour phase, and presence of dominant aqueous (w) or 
carbonic (c) species (see Table 2 for explanation of abbreviations). Salinities for the aqueous 
inclusions were calculated from Tm(ice) using the equations in Bodnar and Vityk (1994). 
Salinities for aqueo-carbonic inclusions were calculated using degree of fill, Th(CO2) and 
Tm(clath) by using the equation of state in Bodnar (1983) and Brown and Lamb (1986, 1989) in 
the Linkam Scientific PVTX Software Modelling programme for Fluid Inclusions, V 2.1. Bulk 
densities of FIP’s were calculated using the computer programme Bulk, version 01/03 (Bakker, 
2003), and isochors were calculated and plotted using Isochor version 13/03/96 (Bakker, 1997) 
and Isoc version 01/03 (Bakker, 2003) utilizing the Bowers and Helgeson (1983) and Zhang and 
Frantz (1987) equations of state.

(1) aqueous inclusions 
Aqueous fluid inclusions are found as both isolated inclusions (Fig. 4A-B) and secondary planes 
(Fig. 4C). Initial melting of isolated inclusions at between -50 and -35 °C is interpreted to be 
eutectic melting. Eutectic melting temperatures of isolated inclusions indicate the presence of 
H2O-NaCl+MgCl2±CaCl2 (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). Isolated inclusions range in size 
between 12-30µm diameter, with 8-20% vapour. Final ice melting temperatures (Tm(ice)) for 
isolated inclusions range from -9.5°C to -21.1°C (Fig. 5A), corresponding to salinities of 
between 13.4 and 23.1 wt.% NaClequiv. Final homogenisation (Tht) was to the liquid phase 
ranging from 86 to 129°C (Fig. 5B). 
 
Aqueous fluid inclusions in trails and in planes contain 10-35% vapour. Initial melting of 
aqueous phases, interpreted as eutectic melting (Te), occurred between -55 and -23 °C, which 
corresponds to a composition of H2O-NaCl±CaCl2±MgCl2±KCl (Goldstein and Reynolds, 
1994). Tm(ice) for FIP’s ranges from -1.6 to -21.2 °C (Fig. 5A), indicating salinities between 2.7 
and 23.2 wt.% NaClequiv Total homogenisation (Tht) for FIP’s was always to the liquid phase, 
between 131 and 208 °C (Fig. 5B).

of aqueous isolated (primary) and trail (secondary) inclusions. B: Histogram showing the final 
homogenisation temperature (Tht in °C) distribution of all aqueous and aqueous carbonic 
inclusions.  
 
 
(2) aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
Several inclusions consist of mixed aqueous and non-aqueous phases. The non-aqueous 
components (carbonic) refer to CO2, CH4, N2, C2H6 and H2S. Isolated aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
(Fig. 4 D, H-I) range in size between 8-20µm, with between 10-60% vapour. This inclusion type 
also occurs as secondary trails (Fig. 4 E-G), with vapour phases ranging between 8 and 90 vol%.

--- Page 14 ---
Melting of isolated carbonic phases (Tm(CO2)) are between -56.8 and -57.9 °C, and between -
58.7 and -56.9 °C for FIP’s (Fig. 6 A). Homogenisation of the carbonic components (Th(CO2)) in 
isolated inclusions was to the liquid phase at between 11.8 and 26.9 °C, and between 16.6 and 
30.8 °C for FIP’s (Fig. 6B). Total homogenisation temperatures (Tht) range between 128 and 245 
°C for FIP’s (Fig. 5B). Raman microspectrometry revealed the possible presence of magnesite 
(MgCO3) in one isolated inclusion (CBSqz3A(6)11) with Th(CO2) = 23.9°C. Carbonic phases of 
isolated inclusions consist of CO2 (determined with Raman spectroscopy) ranging between 98 
and >99.5 mol%, with N2 and CH4 comprising the remainder of the vapour. Carbonic phases in 
inclusions in FIP’s contain between 32 and >99.8 mol% CO2, <0.5 to 55.5 mol% N2, 0.3 to 35.5 
mol% CH4, and <0.1 mol% H2S (determined with Raman spectroscopy). Salinities for isolated 
inclusions range between 11.9 and 13.2 wt.% NaClequiv, and between 3.6 and 19.6 wt.% NaClequiv 
in FIP’s. Bulk densities range between 0.62 and 1.00 g/cm3.

(3) Carbonic methane inclusions  
A distinctive population of fluid inclusion planes comprising numerous methane inclusions was 
identified, ranging in size between 7-16µm (Fig. 4 J-L). Th(CH4) was to the liquid phase at 
between -88.7 and -86.5 °C (Fig. 6C). Raman spectroscopy indicated the presence of between 
6.5 and 7 mol% N2 and between 0.5 and 1 mol% C2H6. The inclusions are classified according to 
their phase behaviour as H1-type inclusions with homogenisation as the final phase transition 
(Van den Kerkhof, 1990). 
 
INTERPRETATION OF FLUID TYPES 
 
Early fluids 
 
Isolated inclusions are interpreted as primary inclusions, and therefore represent a fluid that 
circulated early in the basin history. Salinities of primary aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
range between 11.9 and 23.1 wt% NaClequiv (Fig. 7A), and final homogenisation temperatures 
range from 86 to 129°C. 
 
Low-temperature - high-salinity fluids may result from dissolution of evaporites, shale 
membrane filtration (Graf, 1982), or boiling of a lower salinity fluid. The effect of boiling, or 
effervescence, whereby the vapour of a high-density fluid is trapped as a low-density fluid 
(Roedder, 1984), was not observed in this study. The Katanga sequence hosts abundant 
evaporites in the upper Roan at Mufulira and Konkola, and within the lower Roan (Garlick, 
1974). Therefore, the high salinities and low trapping temperatures of isolated aqueous fluid 
inclusions in this study are best explained by the dissolution of evaporites by circulating connate 
fluids. 
 
Later fluids 
 
Secondary inclusions are interpreted to represent fluids that circulated later in the basin history 
and are characterised by two distinct salinity populations (Fig. 7), namely a low-salinity (~6 
wt.% NaClequiv), higher temperature (~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% 
NaClequiv), lower temperature (~130-160°C) group. The high-salinity group is considered to form 
from circulating basinal fluids that become increasingly saline and slightly hotter with 
progressive dissolution of evaporites. The presence of a later, low-salinity, but slightly hotter, 
fluid may best be explained by devolatilisation reactions during the onset of Lufilian regional 
metamorphism. Methane, also in secondary inclusion planes, is derived from the decomposition 
of hydrocarbon organic matter as it passes through the oil window (~60-150°C).

Figure 7:  A: Frequency vs salinity (wt.% NaClequiv) for all aqueous and aqueous-carbonic 
inclusions from isolated and trail populations show a large spread. B: Salinity (expressed in 
wt.% NaClequiv) vs homogenisation temperatures (Tht) to the liquid phase for primary (black 
diamonds) and secondary (white squares) aqueous inclusions. Secondary fluid inclusions show 
two groups in terms of salinity, namely a low-salinity (~6 wt.% NaClequiv) higher temperature 
(~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% NaClequiv) lower temperature (~130-
160°C) group. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Fluids that immediately post-date stratiform mineralisation are fairly homogeneous in 
composition and show moderate to high salinities (~12-23 wt.% NaClequiv). Conversely, later 
fluids exhibit a range in salinities (~6-23 wt.% NaClequiv), compositions, and trapping 
temperatures. Progressive sediment burial during diagenesis and the resultant heating of connate 
fluids is evident from Figure 7B, where an early high-salinity fluid evolves to a slightly higher 
temperature high-salinity fluid. As metamorphism increases, devolatilization reactions result in 
the production of a fluid of lower salinity, but at higher temperatures. 
 
Isochors plotted on a pressure-temperature diagram give an estimation of P-T conditions during 
fluid trapping (Roedder, 1984; Reynolds and Goldstein, 1994). Intersection of aqueous and 
carbonic isochors of homogeneously trapped inclusions constrains the range of P-T conditions 
applicable to the present study. Isochors for isolated aqueous inclusions were constructed for Tht 
ranging between 107 and 129°C, and for Tht ranging between 131 and 208°C for FIP’s. 
Intersection of aqueous and carbonic isochors in this study constrains the pressure and 
temperature of fluid inclusion trapping to around 480-800 bar and 130-270 °C (Fig. 8). These 
data reconstruct the pressure- and temperature conditions of the environment associated with 
(and immediately post-dating) stratiform copper mineralisation, prior to peak metamorphism.  
 
Previous P-T estimates for mineralising fluids by Kamona (1993), Richards et al. (1988a) and 
Speiser et al. (1995) are also plotted on Figure 8. The data by Kamona (1993) constrain the 
 
13

--- Page 17 ---
characteristics of epigenetic carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralising fluids at Kabwe, a 
mineralisation style that post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation. These fluids are hotter than 
those detected in the present study. The data by Speiser et al. (1995) show the pressure and 
temperature ranges for conditions associated with epigenetic iron-oxide-copper-gold 
mineralisation to the northwest of the Copperbelt. This epigenetic-hydrothermal vein-style 
mineralisation (dated at ~503-512 Ma, Torrealday et al., 1999) post-dates earlier stratiform 
copper mineralisation and is considered coeval with the peak of regional metamorphism in the 
Lufilian arc. Pressures and temperatures associated with this style of mineralisation are 
substantially higher than those documented in this study (Fig. 8). Similarly, the data from 
Richards et al. (1988a) constrain the P-T conditions prevalent during late hydrothermal veining 
at the Musoshi deposit in the DRC, which is associated with alteration. This event of 
hydrothermal alteration, dated at ~514 Ma (Richards et al., 1988b), is related to peak Lufilian 
metamorphism and post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation. The range of temperatures 
attained by Richards et al. (1988a) also exceeds those obtained during this study, which 
constrains, for the first time, the characteristics of a late-diagenetic fluid associated with the 
environment of stratiform copper mineralisation in terms of composition, salinity, pressure and 
temperature. This study also documents the character of fluids that evolved subsequent to 
stratiform mineralisation, and which are associated with the onset of early metamorphism.

THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
ABSTRACT 
 
Fluid inclusions from a mineralised lateral secretion quartz vein-set in the Chambishi open pit 
in the Zambian Copperbelt represent fluids that immediately post-date stratiform copper 
mineralisation. Petrographic evidence indicates that this vein set predates deformation in the 
area. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy of aqueous and aqueo-
carbonic inclusions indicate the presence of an early saline H2O-NaCl+MgCl2±CaCl2±CO2 
±CH4 ±N2 fluid (11.9-23.1 wt.% NaClequiv) at homogenisation temperatures of 86-129°C. 
Later fluids occur in fluid inclusion planes and are linked to early metamorphism of the basin. 
These fluids are more varied in composition and are aqueous, aqueo-carbonic, and pure 
methane inclusions. Aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions are H2O-NaCl ±CaCl2 ±MgCl2 
±KCl ±CO2, N2, CH4, H2S fluids, with two salinity end-members, namely, a high salinity (18-
23 wt.% NaClequiv) - lower temperature (~130-160°C) fluid, and a lower salinity (~6 wt.% 
NaClequiv) - higher temperature (~140-210 °C) fluid. Later carbonic inclusion planes contain 
CH4, with N2 and C2H6. Later fluids are complex in composition, salinity, and 
homogenisation temperatures and are thought to be late-diagenetic on the one hand, and early 
(methane productive) metamorphic on the other. Pressure and temperature conditions in the 
environment immediately after stratiform copper mineralisation occurred were around 480-
800 bar and 130-270 °C.

THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Neoproterozoic stratiform Cu-Co ores of the Central African Copperbelt are hosted mainly 
by the Roan Group at the base of the Katanga Supergroup. This metallogenic province is situated 
on the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and is 
preserved in the Lufulian Arc (Fig. 1). Theories on the origin of mineralisation of these 
sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits have ranged from syngenetic (Garlick, 1961; 
Fleischer, 1984; Sweeney and Binda, 1994) to epigenetic (Jackson, 1932; McGowan et al., 
2003). However, recent models of ore deposition favour either early- or late diagenesis (Robb, 
2005). In addition, the presence of a variety of epigenetic ores such as the Cu-Au, U- (Cu-Co-
Ni-Mo), and Zn-Pb-Cu-Ge-Ga deposits within the Katanga metallogenic province illustrates the 
scale and complexity of mineralisation styles. Therefore, regional metallogenesis is best viewed 
in a polygenetic framework. This paper describes the fluid inclusion character of quartz veins 
from the Chambishi deposit (Figs. 1, 2). This forms part of a regional fluid study aimed at 
deciphering and documenting the characteristics and evolution of early fluids (late diagenetic), 
possibly associated with mineralisation, and late fluids (trapped during regional metamorphism 
post-dating stratiform mineralisation).

for this study is indicated in the Ore Shale horizon. 
 
GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The stratiform copper deposits of the Central African Copperbelt are hosted by the meta-
sediments of the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup (Fig. 1). The Katanga Supergroup 
unconformably overlies a basement comprised of an exposed Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline 
volcanic arc terrane (Rainaud et al., 1999), which in turn overlies a Mesoarchaean terrane 
(Rainaud et al., 2003). This basement is intruded by granitoids, which constrains the maximum 
age of Katangan sedimentation (Armstrong et al., 1999). The Katanga succession in Zambia is 
composed of the Roan, Mwashya, Nguba, and Kundelungu Groups, as specified by Wendorff 
(2003). Sedimentation of the Katanga occurred between 880 Ma (Armstrong et al., 1999) and 
620 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984), with the onset of the Roan Group arenites, argillites, and shales 
deposited during rifting (Wendorff, 2003). According to Wendorff (2003), the Roan Group is 
overlain by the Mwashya Group, unconformably in the Kafue anticline region in Zambia, and 
non-conformably on the pre-Katanga basement in the DRC. Two tillites are present in the Nguba 
Group, which is comprised of marine siliciclastics and carbonate rocks. The base of the Nguba 
Group is indicated by the first tillite, the so-called Grand Conglomérat, which probably 
corresponds to the Sturtian glaciation (Robb et al., 2002; Robb, 2005). 
 
The Katanga sediments were metamorphosed during the Lufilian orogenic event at c. 600-500 
Ma (John et al., 2002) to greenschist facies in the Zambian Copperbelt, and to amphibolite facies 
in the Solwezi area to the west of the Copperbelt, with a general decrease in grade to the 
northeast, towards the DRC (Mendelsohn, 1961a). The Katanga metasediments are preserved in 
several structural basins (e.g., Konkola, Chambishi, Roan). 
 
 
 
REGIONAL STRATIFORM COPPER MINERALISATION 
 
Mineralisation in Zambia and the DRC is mainly hosted in the lower Roan Group, but minor 
occurrences of mineralisation are also found in the basement and in the dolomites of the Nguba

Group. Ore minerals are mostly sulphides (including bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite, carrollite, 
and pyrite), and secondary oxides. Mineralisation in the lower Roan Group is hosted in two 
lithologies, namely, argillaceous shales and arenaceous quartzites and arkoses. Generally, the 
deposits of the Ore Shale (Fig. 2) are located along the west of the Kafue anticline (Fig. 1). The 
Ore Shale consists mostly of silty, micaceous (biotite or sericite ± muscovite), calcareous grains, 
with quartz, feldspar, carbonate, Cu-Fe sulphides, chlorite and organic carbon. The thickness 
varies from 5-20 m, and sulphides are generally disseminated through the Ore Shale, with 
concentrations along bedding planes (Mendelsohn, 1961b). The sericitic quartzite-hosted 
deposits are found along the eastern flank of the Kafue anticline in the Mufulira area (Fig. 1). 
 
PREVIOUS FLUID INCLUSION STUDIES: ZAMBIA AND THE DRC 
 
Previous fluid inclusion studies in Zambia and the DRC include work by Pirmolin (1970), 
Sweeney (1987), Richards et al. (1988a), Speiser et al. (1995), and Kamona (1993). A summary 
of the main results is presented in Table 1, with the section below outlining the main findings of 
each of these studies. 
 
• Pirmolin (1970) described fluid inclusions from an unmineralised cherty dolomite layer of 
the Mines Group of the Roan Group at Kamoto in the DRC, and concluded that the solutions 
in this area reached temperatures of ~200°C at salinities of ~40 wt. % NaClequiv . 
• Crosscutting quartz veins at the Konkola and Chambishi Cu-Co deposits were studied by 
Sweeney (1987). These veins had undergone at least one post-formational tectono-thermal 
event. Scanning electron microscopy of decrepitated inclusion cavities showed the presence 
of Na, Al, Si, S, U, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Co, and KCl, NaCl daughter minerals. Gas analyses 
of decrepitated inclusions revealed the presence of CO2, CH4, and N2. It was concluded that 
the veins formed by lateral migration of fluids during late diagenetic dewatering. 
• Richards et al. (1988a) indicated the presence of a sylvite-halite-saturated fluid in quartz-
hematite-rutile veins hosted in the footwall sediments of the Musoshi copper deposit (DRC), 
where late hydrothermal veining caused extensive footwall- and Ore Shale- alteration. Fluid 
inclusions were found to consist of NaCl, KCl ± CO2. This hydrothermal event postdates 
stratiform copper mineralisation and is linked to compressional deformation and 
metamorphism during the Lufilian orogeny. They estimated the maximum homogenisation 
pressure at 1.2 kbar, which is the typical pressure for decrepitation of 12-13µm size fluid 
inclusions in quartz (Leroy, 1979). 
• Epigenetic iron-oxide-Cu-Au type mineralisation at the Kansanshi Copper Mine (Solwezi 
area, northwestern Zambia) was studied by Speiser et al. (1995) and Speiser (1994). 
Hydrothermal veining at Kansanshi is connected with alteration of the host rocks, and 
mineralised (Cu-Mo-Fe) veins have been dated at ~503-511 Ma (Re-Os and U-Pb of 
molybdenite and monazite) by Torrealday et al. (1999). Mineralisation at the Kansanshi 
Mine may also correspond to mineralisation at the Shinkwelobwe Mine (Cu-U), which is 
dated at 602 Ma (U/Pb, Cahen and Snelling, 1984). This style of mineralisation post-dated 
host-rock metamorphism. 
• Kamona (1993) studied fluids from the epigenetic stratabound carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn 
Kabwe deposit, central Zambia. This epigenetic deposit is hosted by the Kabwe Dolomite 
Formation, where mineralising fluids were saline, ranging between 11-31 wt.% NaClequiv, 
and Th ranged between 257 and 305°C, corresponding to ore deposition at 320°C. 
• Kampunzu et al. (1998) reported fluid inclusions from the epigenetic sediment-hosted Pb-Zn 
Kipushi deposit with high homogenisation temperatures (300°C) as temperatures of 
mineralising fluids. This style of mineralisation post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation.

The work of Pirmolin (1970) and Sweeney (1987) is relevant to the present study. Their data 
indicate that fluids circulated early during the basin evolution, and were saline with moderate 
homogenisation temperatures. The present study, however, provides information on a vein set in 
a mineralised setting, where the tectonic and paragenetic relationships are better constrained. 
Accordingly, this study will add to existing knowledge of early tectonic fluids.  
 
 
CHAMBISHI COPPER DEPOSIT 
 
Two deposits are identified in the Chambishi area, namely the Chambishi Main and the 
Chambishi West orebodies (Garlick, 1961; Garlick, 1976), where the Katanga metasediments 
unconformably overlie the 2050-1850 Ma basement comprising granitoids and the Lufubu 
schists (Master et al., 2004; Rainaud et al., 2004). The Katanga metasediments are preserved 
along the northern rim of the Chambishi-Nkana basin, striking east-west, and dipping south at 
about 60° (Garlick, 1961). The Ore Shale in this area consists of carbonaceous shale, siltstone, 
argillite, and interbedded dolomite (Fig. 2). Disseminated copper (± cobalt) sulphide 
mineralisation is present within the Ore Shale of the lower Roan Group (Fleischer, 1984). 
Zonation of chalcopyrite-bornite-chalcocite is present in the Ore Shale. The barren shale 
overlying the Ore Shale is mineralised with disseminated pyrite. Secondary malachite occurs as 
an oxidation product of primary sulphides. 
 
Copper mineralisation in the Ore Shale was followed by the formation of bedding parallel quartz 
veins. Figure 3A illustrates a depleted halo surrounding a quartz vein where copper sulphides 
have been remobilized from the shale into the quartz vein. The mineralised sediments were 
subsequently metamorphosed and folded resulting in the development of an axial planar 
cleavage (Fig. 3B). This cleavage is refracted through the quartz vein (Fig. 3C), indicating a 
process of lateral secretion prior to metamorphism (see Fig. 3D).

Figure 3: Lateral secretion of primary copper mineralisation from the surrounding shale into a 
quartz vein, leaving a halo, depleted of mineralisation, surrounding the quartz vein in the Ore 
Shale horizon (A). The axial planar cleavage (B), produced during folding of the Ore Shale, is 
refracted by the intruding vein (C), which shows that the introduction of the vein preceded 
folding of the strata, but post-dated the stratiform mineralisation.  
 
CHAMBISHI FLUID INCLUSIONS 
 
Sample selection 
 
Samples were selected from the quartz vein hosted in the Ore Shale Formation illustrated in 
Figure 3. The early pre-orogenic tectonic setting of this particular vein is indicated by the axial 
planar cleavage, which is refracted from the shale through the quartz vein. 
 
Petrography 
 
Certain minerals host fluid inclusions, which become trapped either during, or subsequent to, 
crystal growth (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The relationship between individual inclusions, 
and amongst inclusions and growth zones, indicates the relative timing of entrapment. Based on 
petrographic observations, fluid inclusions and fluid inclusion assemblages may be identified as 
primary, secondary, or pseudo-secondary (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). 
Assuming that no leaking or resetting has occurred during metamorphism in the Chambishi 
basin, primary inclusions found in this setting are interpreted as representative of pre-
metamorphic fluids. Conversely, pseudo-secondary and secondary inclusions will be distinctive 
of fluids present during (and to some extent after) metamorphism.  
 
In this study double-polished quartz wafers showed no growth zonation during optical 
microscopy or cathodoluminescence. However, a few small (<10µm), isolated inclusions are 
interpreted to be of primary origin based on their isolated distribution among secondary fluid 
inclusion planes (FIP’s) (Fig. 4 D, E, H, I). These inclusions are interpreted to be representative 
of post-mineralising, pre-metamorphic  fluids. Secondary fluid inclusions form when fluid is 
trapped during healing of microcracks, shear planes, or along twin planes or cleavage directions 
after crystal formation (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The majority of inclusions documented 
here are interpreted as secondary. Therefore, inclusions in trails and fluid inclusion planes have 
trapped later fluids that also post-date mineralisation, but are coeval with deformation (Fig. 4 A-
C, G, J-L). This study reports the characteristics of fluids trapped subsequent to mineralisation, 
and coeval with deformation of the Chambishi basin.

Methodology 
 
Double polished wafers of ~200 µm thickness were used for the petrographic and 
microthermometric study. Microthermometry was performed on a Linkam TH600 stage 
connected to an Olympus Vanox binocular microscope. The accuracy of the measurements was 
of ± 0.1°C at low temperatures and ± 2°C at high temperatures. Inclusions were cooled to -
170°C and phase transitions were measured during heating. Estimates of the volumes of volatile 
phases at room temperature was undertaken using the volumetric estimation chart of Roedder 
(1972). The gaseous molar fractions were determined using a Raman Labram Jobin-Yvon 
microspectrometer, with an ionised Ar laser (wavelength 514.5 nm) as excitation source. The 
laser was focused on the sample with an 80x objective lens. 
 
Fluid inclusion types are defined according to the nomenclature used by Boiron et al. (1992). 
Inclusions are classified based on their final homogenisation (Tht) behaviour (see Table 2), L: 
into the liquid phase, V: into the vapour phase, and presence of dominant aqueous (w) or 
carbonic (c) species (see Table 2 for explanation of abbreviations). Salinities for the aqueous 
inclusions were calculated from Tm(ice) using the equations in Bodnar and Vityk (1994). 
Salinities for aqueo-carbonic inclusions were calculated using degree of fill, Th(CO2) and 
Tm(clath) by using the equation of state in Bodnar (1983) and Brown and Lamb (1986, 1989) in 
the Linkam Scientific PVTX Software Modelling programme for Fluid Inclusions, V 2.1. Bulk 
densities of FIP’s were calculated using the computer programme Bulk, version 01/03 (Bakker, 
2003), and isochors were calculated and plotted using Isochor version 13/03/96 (Bakker, 1997) 
and Isoc version 01/03 (Bakker, 2003) utilizing the Bowers and Helgeson (1983) and Zhang and 
Frantz (1987) equations of state.

(1) aqueous inclusions 
Aqueous fluid inclusions are found as both isolated inclusions (Fig. 4A-B) and secondary planes 
(Fig. 4C). Initial melting of isolated inclusions at between -50 and -35 °C is interpreted to be 
eutectic melting. Eutectic melting temperatures of isolated inclusions indicate the presence of 
H2O-NaCl+MgCl2±CaCl2 (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). Isolated inclusions range in size 
between 12-30µm diameter, with 8-20% vapour. Final ice melting temperatures (Tm(ice)) for 
isolated inclusions range from -9.5°C to -21.1°C (Fig. 5A), corresponding to salinities of 
between 13.4 and 23.1 wt.% NaClequiv. Final homogenisation (Tht) was to the liquid phase 
ranging from 86 to 129°C (Fig. 5B). 
 
Aqueous fluid inclusions in trails and in planes contain 10-35% vapour. Initial melting of 
aqueous phases, interpreted as eutectic melting (Te), occurred between -55 and -23 °C, which 
corresponds to a composition of H2O-NaCl±CaCl2±MgCl2±KCl (Goldstein and Reynolds, 
1994). Tm(ice) for FIP’s ranges from -1.6 to -21.2 °C (Fig. 5A), indicating salinities between 2.7 
and 23.2 wt.% NaClequiv Total homogenisation (Tht) for FIP’s was always to the liquid phase, 
between 131 and 208 °C (Fig. 5B). 
 
 
 
Figure 5:   A: Histogram showing the distribution of the final ice melting temperatures (Tmice) 
of aqueous isolated (primary) and trail (secondary) inclusions. B: Histogram showing the final 
homogenisation temperature (Tht in °C) distribution of all aqueous and aqueous carbonic 
inclusions.  
 
 
(2) aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
Several inclusions consist of mixed aqueous and non-aqueous phases. The non-aqueous 
components (carbonic) refer to CO2, CH4, N2, C2H6 and H2S. Isolated aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
(Fig. 4 D, H-I) range in size between 8-20µm, with between 10-60% vapour. This inclusion type 
also occurs as secondary trails (Fig. 4 E-G), with vapour phases ranging between 8 and 90 vol%.

--- Page 14 ---
Melting of isolated carbonic phases (Tm(CO2)) are between -56.8 and -57.9 °C, and between -
58.7 and -56.9 °C for FIP’s (Fig. 6 A). Homogenisation of the carbonic components (Th(CO2)) in 
isolated inclusions was to the liquid phase at between 11.8 and 26.9 °C, and between 16.6 and 
30.8 °C for FIP’s (Fig. 6B). Total homogenisation temperatures (Tht) range between 128 and 245 
°C for FIP’s (Fig. 5B). Raman microspectrometry revealed the possible presence of magnesite 
(MgCO3) in one isolated inclusion (CBSqz3A(6)11) with Th(CO2) = 23.9°C. Carbonic phases of 
isolated inclusions consist of CO2 (determined with Raman spectroscopy) ranging between 98 
and >99.5 mol%, with N2 and CH4 comprising the remainder of the vapour. Carbonic phases in 
inclusions in FIP’s contain between 32 and >99.8 mol% CO2, <0.5 to 55.5 mol% N2, 0.3 to 35.5 
mol% CH4, and <0.1 mol% H2S (determined with Raman spectroscopy). Salinities for isolated 
inclusions range between 11.9 and 13.2 wt.% NaClequiv, and between 3.6 and 19.6 wt.% NaClequiv 
in FIP’s. Bulk densities range between 0.62 and 1.00 g/cm3.

(3) Carbonic methane inclusions  
A distinctive population of fluid inclusion planes comprising numerous methane inclusions was 
identified, ranging in size between 7-16µm (Fig. 4 J-L). Th(CH4) was to the liquid phase at 
between -88.7 and -86.5 °C (Fig. 6C). Raman spectroscopy indicated the presence of between 
6.5 and 7 mol% N2 and between 0.5 and 1 mol% C2H6. The inclusions are classified according to 
their phase behaviour as H1-type inclusions with homogenisation as the final phase transition 
(Van den Kerkhof, 1990). 
 
INTERPRETATION OF FLUID TYPES 
 
Early fluids 
 
Isolated inclusions are interpreted as primary inclusions, and therefore represent a fluid that 
circulated early in the basin history. Salinities of primary aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
range between 11.9 and 23.1 wt% NaClequiv (Fig. 7A), and final homogenisation temperatures 
range from 86 to 129°C. 
 
Low-temperature - high-salinity fluids may result from dissolution of evaporites, shale 
membrane filtration (Graf, 1982), or boiling of a lower salinity fluid. The effect of boiling, or 
effervescence, whereby the vapour of a high-density fluid is trapped as a low-density fluid 
(Roedder, 1984), was not observed in this study. The Katanga sequence hosts abundant 
evaporites in the upper Roan at Mufulira and Konkola, and within the lower Roan (Garlick, 
1974). Therefore, the high salinities and low trapping temperatures of isolated aqueous fluid 
inclusions in this study are best explained by the dissolution of evaporites by circulating connate 
fluids. 
 
Later fluids 
 
Secondary inclusions are interpreted to represent fluids that circulated later in the basin history 
and are characterised by two distinct salinity populations (Fig. 7), namely a low-salinity (~6 
wt.% NaClequiv), higher temperature (~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% 
NaClequiv), lower temperature (~130-160°C) group. The high-salinity group is considered to form 
from circulating basinal fluids that become increasingly saline and slightly hotter with 
progressive dissolution of evaporites. The presence of a later, low-salinity, but slightly hotter, 
fluid may best be explained by devolatilisation reactions during the onset of Lufilian regional 
metamorphism. Methane, also in secondary inclusion planes, is derived from the decomposition 
of hydrocarbon organic matter as it passes through the oil window (~60-150°C).

Figure 7:  A: Frequency vs salinity (wt.% NaClequiv) for all aqueous and aqueous-carbonic 
inclusions from isolated and trail populations show a large spread. B: Salinity (expressed in 
wt.% NaClequiv) vs homogenisation temperatures (Tht) to the liquid phase for primary (black 
diamonds) and secondary (white squares) aqueous inclusions. Secondary fluid inclusions show 
two groups in terms of salinity, namely a low-salinity (~6 wt.% NaClequiv) higher temperature 
(~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% NaClequiv) lower temperature (~130-
160°C) group. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Fluids that immediately post-date stratiform mineralisation are fairly homogeneous in 
composition and show moderate to high salinities (~12-23 wt.% NaClequiv). Conversely, later 
fluids exhibit a range in salinities (~6-23 wt.% NaClequiv), compositions, and trapping 
temperatures. Progressive sediment burial during diagenesis and the resultant heating of connate 
fluids is evident from Figure 7B, where an early high-salinity fluid evolves to a slightly higher 
temperature high-salinity fluid. As metamorphism increases, devolatilization reactions result in 
the production of a fluid of lower salinity, but at higher temperatures. 
 
Isochors plotted on a pressure-temperature diagram give an estimation of P-T conditions during 
fluid trapping (Roedder, 1984; Reynolds and Goldstein, 1994). Intersection of aqueous and 
carbonic isochors of homogeneously trapped inclusions constrains the range of P-T conditions 
applicable to the present study. Isochors for isolated aqueous inclusions were constructed for Tht 
ranging between 107 and 129°C, and for Tht ranging between 131 and 208°C for FIP’s. 
Intersection of aqueous and carbonic isochors in this study constrains the pressure and 
temperature of fluid inclusion trapping to around 480-800 bar and 130-270 °C (Fig. 8). These 
data reconstruct the pressure- and temperature conditions of the environment associated with 
(and immediately post-dating) stratiform copper mineralisation, prior to peak metamorphism.  
 
Previous P-T estimates for mineralising fluids by Kamona (1993), Richards et al. (1988a) and 
Speiser et al. (1995) are also plotted on Figure 8. The data by Kamona (1993) constrain the 
 
13

--- Page 17 ---
characteristics of epigenetic carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralising fluids at Kabwe, a 
mineralisation style that post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation. These fluids are hotter than 
those detected in the present study. The data by Speiser et al. (1995) show the pressure and 
temperature ranges for conditions associated with epigenetic iron-oxide-copper-gold 
mineralisation to the northwest of the Copperbelt. This epigenetic-hydrothermal vein-style 
mineralisation (dated at ~503-512 Ma, Torrealday et al., 1999) post-dates earlier stratiform 
copper mineralisation and is considered coeval with the peak of regional metamorphism in the 
Lufilian arc. Pressures and temperatures associated with this style of mineralisation are 
substantially higher than those documented in this study (Fig. 8). Similarly, the data from 
Richards et al. (1988a) constrain the P-T conditions prevalent during late hydrothermal veining 
at the Musoshi deposit in the DRC, which is associated with alteration. This event of 
hydrothermal alteration, dated at ~514 Ma (Richards et al., 1988b), is related to peak Lufilian 
metamorphism and post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation. The range of temperatures 
attained by Richards et al. (1988a) also exceeds those obtained during this study, which 
constrains, for the first time, the characteristics of a late-diagenetic fluid associated with the 
environment of stratiform copper mineralisation in terms of composition, salinity, pressure and 
temperature. This study also documents the character of fluids that evolved subsequent to 
stratiform mineralisation, and which are associated with the onset of early metamorphism.

THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
ABSTRACT 
 
Fluid inclusions from a mineralised lateral secretion quartz vein-set in the Chambishi open pit 
in the Zambian Copperbelt represent fluids that immediately post-date stratiform copper 
mineralisation. Petrographic evidence indicates that this vein set predates deformation in the 
area. Fluid inclusion microthermometry and Raman spectroscopy of aqueous and aqueo-
carbonic inclusions indicate the presence of an early saline H2O-NaCl+MgCl2±CaCl2±CO2 
±CH4 ±N2 fluid (11.9-23.1 wt.% NaClequiv) at homogenisation temperatures of 86-129°C. 
Later fluids occur in fluid inclusion planes and are linked to early metamorphism of the basin. 
These fluids are more varied in composition and are aqueous, aqueo-carbonic, and pure 
methane inclusions. Aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions are H2O-NaCl ±CaCl2 ±MgCl2 
±KCl ±CO2, N2, CH4, H2S fluids, with two salinity end-members, namely, a high salinity (18-
23 wt.% NaClequiv) - lower temperature (~130-160°C) fluid, and a lower salinity (~6 wt.% 
NaClequiv) - higher temperature (~140-210 °C) fluid. Later carbonic inclusion planes contain 
CH4, with N2 and C2H6. Later fluids are complex in composition, salinity, and 
homogenisation temperatures and are thought to be late-diagenetic on the one hand, and early 
(methane productive) metamorphic on the other. Pressure and temperature conditions in the 
environment immediately after stratiform copper mineralisation occurred were around 480-
800 bar and 130-270 °C.

THE NATURE OF BASINAL FLUIDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE CHAMBISHI DEPOSIT, ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Neoproterozoic stratiform Cu-Co ores of the Central African Copperbelt are hosted mainly 
by the Roan Group at the base of the Katanga Supergroup. This metallogenic province is situated 
on the border between Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and is 
preserved in the Lufulian Arc (Fig. 1). Theories on the origin of mineralisation of these 
sediment-hosted stratiform copper deposits have ranged from syngenetic (Garlick, 1961; 
Fleischer, 1984; Sweeney and Binda, 1994) to epigenetic (Jackson, 1932; McGowan et al., 
2003). However, recent models of ore deposition favour either early- or late diagenesis (Robb, 
2005). In addition, the presence of a variety of epigenetic ores such as the Cu-Au, U- (Cu-Co-
Ni-Mo), and Zn-Pb-Cu-Ge-Ga deposits within the Katanga metallogenic province illustrates the 
scale and complexity of mineralisation styles. Therefore, regional metallogenesis is best viewed 
in a polygenetic framework. This paper describes the fluid inclusion character of quartz veins 
from the Chambishi deposit (Figs. 1, 2). This forms part of a regional fluid study aimed at 
deciphering and documenting the characteristics and evolution of early fluids (late diagenetic), 
possibly associated with mineralisation, and late fluids (trapped during regional metamorphism 
post-dating stratiform mineralisation).

GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
The stratiform copper deposits of the Central African Copperbelt are hosted by the meta-
sediments of the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup (Fig. 1). The Katanga Supergroup 
unconformably overlies a basement comprised of an exposed Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline 
volcanic arc terrane (Rainaud et al., 1999), which in turn overlies a Mesoarchaean terrane 
(Rainaud et al., 2003). This basement is intruded by granitoids, which constrains the maximum 
age of Katangan sedimentation (Armstrong et al., 1999). The Katanga succession in Zambia is 
composed of the Roan, Mwashya, Nguba, and Kundelungu Groups, as specified by Wendorff 
(2003). Sedimentation of the Katanga occurred between 880 Ma (Armstrong et al., 1999) and 
620 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984), with the onset of the Roan Group arenites, argillites, and shales 
deposited during rifting (Wendorff, 2003). According to Wendorff (2003), the Roan Group is 
overlain by the Mwashya Group, unconformably in the Kafue anticline region in Zambia, and 
non-conformably on the pre-Katanga basement in the DRC. Two tillites are present in the Nguba 
Group, which is comprised of marine siliciclastics and carbonate rocks. The base of the Nguba 
Group is indicated by the first tillite, the so-called Grand Conglomérat, which probably 
corresponds to the Sturtian glaciation (Robb et al., 2002; Robb, 2005). 
 
The Katanga sediments were metamorphosed during the Lufilian orogenic event at c. 600-500 
Ma (John et al., 2002) to greenschist facies in the Zambian Copperbelt, and to amphibolite facies 
in the Solwezi area to the west of the Copperbelt, with a general decrease in grade to the 
northeast, towards the DRC (Mendelsohn, 1961a). The Katanga metasediments are preserved in 
several structural basins (e.g., Konkola, Chambishi, Roan). 
 
 
 
REGIONAL STRATIFORM COPPER MINERALISATION 
 
Mineralisation in Zambia and the DRC is mainly hosted in the lower Roan Group, but minor 
occurrences of mineralisation are also found in the basement and in the dolomites of the Nguba

--- Page 6 ---
Group. Ore minerals are mostly sulphides (including bornite, chalcocite, chalcopyrite, carrollite, 
and pyrite), and secondary oxides. Mineralisation in the lower Roan Group is hosted in two 
lithologies, namely, argillaceous shales and arenaceous quartzites and arkoses. Generally, the 
deposits of the Ore Shale (Fig. 2) are located along the west of the Kafue anticline (Fig. 1). The 
Ore Shale consists mostly of silty, micaceous (biotite or sericite ± muscovite), calcareous grains, 
with quartz, feldspar, carbonate, Cu-Fe sulphides, chlorite and organic carbon. The thickness 
varies from 5-20 m, and sulphides are generally disseminated through the Ore Shale, with 
concentrations along bedding planes (Mendelsohn, 1961b). The sericitic quartzite-hosted 
deposits are found along the eastern flank of the Kafue anticline in the Mufulira area (Fig. 1). 
 
PREVIOUS FLUID INCLUSION STUDIES: ZAMBIA AND THE DRC 
 
Previous fluid inclusion studies in Zambia and the DRC include work by Pirmolin (1970), 
Sweeney (1987), Richards et al. (1988a), Speiser et al. (1995), and Kamona (1993). A summary 
of the main results is presented in Table 1, with the section below outlining the main findings of 
each of these studies. 
 
• Pirmolin (1970) described fluid inclusions from an unmineralised cherty dolomite layer of 
the Mines Group of the Roan Group at Kamoto in the DRC, and concluded that the solutions 
in this area reached temperatures of ~200°C at salinities of ~40 wt. % NaClequiv . 
• Crosscutting quartz veins at the Konkola and Chambishi Cu-Co deposits were studied by 
Sweeney (1987). These veins had undergone at least one post-formational tectono-thermal 
event. Scanning electron microscopy of decrepitated inclusion cavities showed the presence 
of Na, Al, Si, S, U, K, Ca, Fe, Cu, and Co, and KCl, NaCl daughter minerals. Gas analyses 
of decrepitated inclusions revealed the presence of CO2, CH4, and N2. It was concluded that 
the veins formed by lateral migration of fluids during late diagenetic dewatering. 
• Richards et al. (1988a) indicated the presence of a sylvite-halite-saturated fluid in quartz-
hematite-rutile veins hosted in the footwall sediments of the Musoshi copper deposit (DRC), 
where late hydrothermal veining caused extensive footwall- and Ore Shale- alteration. Fluid 
inclusions were found to consist of NaCl, KCl ± CO2. This hydrothermal event postdates 
stratiform copper mineralisation and is linked to compressional deformation and 
metamorphism during the Lufilian orogeny. They estimated the maximum homogenisation 
pressure at 1.2 kbar, which is the typical pressure for decrepitation of 12-13µm size fluid 
inclusions in quartz (Leroy, 1979). 
• Epigenetic iron-oxide-Cu-Au type mineralisation at the Kansanshi Copper Mine (Solwezi 
area, northwestern Zambia) was studied by Speiser et al. (1995) and Speiser (1994). 
Hydrothermal veining at Kansanshi is connected with alteration of the host rocks, and 
mineralised (Cu-Mo-Fe) veins have been dated at ~503-511 Ma (Re-Os and U-Pb of 
molybdenite and monazite) by Torrealday et al. (1999). Mineralisation at the Kansanshi 
Mine may also correspond to mineralisation at the Shinkwelobwe Mine (Cu-U), which is 
dated at 602 Ma (U/Pb, Cahen and Snelling, 1984). This style of mineralisation post-dated 
host-rock metamorphism. 
• Kamona (1993) studied fluids from the epigenetic stratabound carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn 
Kabwe deposit, central Zambia. This epigenetic deposit is hosted by the Kabwe Dolomite 
Formation, where mineralising fluids were saline, ranging between 11-31 wt.% NaClequiv, 
and Th ranged between 257 and 305°C, corresponding to ore deposition at 320°C. 
• Kampunzu et al. (1998) reported fluid inclusions from the epigenetic sediment-hosted Pb-Zn 
Kipushi deposit with high homogenisation temperatures (300°C) as temperatures of 
mineralising fluids. This style of mineralisation post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation.

The work of Pirmolin (1970) and Sweeney (1987) is relevant to the present study. Their data 
indicate that fluids circulated early during the basin evolution, and were saline with moderate 
homogenisation temperatures. The present study, however, provides information on a vein set in 
a mineralised setting, where the tectonic and paragenetic relationships are better constrained. 
Accordingly, this study will add to existing knowledge of early tectonic fluids.  
 
 
CHAMBISHI COPPER DEPOSIT 
 
Two deposits are identified in the Chambishi area, namely the Chambishi Main and the 
Chambishi West orebodies (Garlick, 1961; Garlick, 1976), where the Katanga metasediments 
unconformably overlie the 2050-1850 Ma basement comprising granitoids and the Lufubu 
schists (Master et al., 2004; Rainaud et al., 2004). The Katanga metasediments are preserved 
along the northern rim of the Chambishi-Nkana basin, striking east-west, and dipping south at 
about 60° (Garlick, 1961). The Ore Shale in this area consists of carbonaceous shale, siltstone, 
argillite, and interbedded dolomite (Fig. 2). Disseminated copper (± cobalt) sulphide 
mineralisation is present within the Ore Shale of the lower Roan Group (Fleischer, 1984). 
Zonation of chalcopyrite-bornite-chalcocite is present in the Ore Shale. The barren shale 
overlying the Ore Shale is mineralised with disseminated pyrite. Secondary malachite occurs as 
an oxidation product of primary sulphides. 
 
Copper mineralisation in the Ore Shale was followed by the formation of bedding parallel quartz 
veins. Figure 3A illustrates a depleted halo surrounding a quartz vein where copper sulphides 
have been remobilized from the shale into the quartz vein. The mineralised sediments were 
subsequently metamorphosed and folded resulting in the development of an axial planar 
cleavage (Fig. 3B). This cleavage is refracted through the quartz vein (Fig. 3C), indicating a 
process of lateral secretion prior to metamorphism (see Fig. 3D).

--- Page 8 ---
 
 
Figure 3: Lateral secretion of primary copper mineralisation from the surrounding shale into a 
quartz vein, leaving a halo, depleted of mineralisation, surrounding the quartz vein in the Ore 
Shale horizon (A). The axial planar cleavage (B), produced during folding of the Ore Shale, is 
refracted by the intruding vein (C), which shows that the introduction of the vein preceded 
folding of the strata, but post-dated the stratiform mineralisation.  
 
CHAMBISHI FLUID INCLUSIONS 
 
Sample selection 
 
Samples were selected from the quartz vein hosted in the Ore Shale Formation illustrated in 
Figure 3. The early pre-orogenic tectonic setting of this particular vein is indicated by the axial 
planar cleavage, which is refracted from the shale through the quartz vein. 
 
Petrography 
 
Certain minerals host fluid inclusions, which become trapped either during, or subsequent to, 
crystal growth (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The relationship between individual inclusions, 
and amongst inclusions and growth zones, indicates the relative timing of entrapment. Based on 
petrographic observations, fluid inclusions and fluid inclusion assemblages may be identified as 
primary, secondary, or pseudo-secondary (Roedder, 1984; Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). 
Assuming that no leaking or resetting has occurred during metamorphism in the Chambishi 
basin, primary inclusions found in this setting are interpreted as representative of pre-
metamorphic fluids. Conversely, pseudo-secondary and secondary inclusions will be distinctive 
of fluids present during (and to some extent after) metamorphism.  
 
In this study double-polished quartz wafers showed no growth zonation during optical 
microscopy or cathodoluminescence. However, a few small (<10µm), isolated inclusions are 
interpreted to be of primary origin based on their isolated distribution among secondary fluid 
inclusion planes (FIP’s) (Fig. 4 D, E, H, I). These inclusions are interpreted to be representative 
of post-mineralising, pre-metamorphic  fluids. Secondary fluid inclusions form when fluid is 
trapped during healing of microcracks, shear planes, or along twin planes or cleavage directions 
after crystal formation (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). The majority of inclusions documented 
here are interpreted as secondary. Therefore, inclusions in trails and fluid inclusion planes have 
trapped later fluids that also post-date mineralisation, but are coeval with deformation (Fig. 4 A-
C, G, J-L). This study reports the characteristics of fluids trapped subsequent to mineralisation, 
and coeval with deformation of the Chambishi basin.

Methodology 
 
Double polished wafers of ~200 µm thickness were used for the petrographic and 
microthermometric study. Microthermometry was performed on a Linkam TH600 stage 
connected to an Olympus Vanox binocular microscope. The accuracy of the measurements was 
of ± 0.1°C at low temperatures and ± 2°C at high temperatures. Inclusions were cooled to -
170°C and phase transitions were measured during heating. Estimates of the volumes of volatile 
phases at room temperature was undertaken using the volumetric estimation chart of Roedder 
(1972). The gaseous molar fractions were determined using a Raman Labram Jobin-Yvon 
microspectrometer, with an ionised Ar laser (wavelength 514.5 nm) as excitation source. The 
laser was focused on the sample with an 80x objective lens. 
 
Fluid inclusion types are defined according to the nomenclature used by Boiron et al. (1992). 
Inclusions are classified based on their final homogenisation (Tht) behaviour (see Table 2), L: 
into the liquid phase, V: into the vapour phase, and presence of dominant aqueous (w) or 
carbonic (c) species (see Table 2 for explanation of abbreviations). Salinities for the aqueous 
inclusions were calculated from Tm(ice) using the equations in Bodnar and Vityk (1994). 
Salinities for aqueo-carbonic inclusions were calculated using degree of fill, Th(CO2) and 
Tm(clath) by using the equation of state in Bodnar (1983) and Brown and Lamb (1986, 1989) in 
the Linkam Scientific PVTX Software Modelling programme for Fluid Inclusions, V 2.1. Bulk 
densities of FIP’s were calculated using the computer programme Bulk, version 01/03 (Bakker, 
2003), and isochors were calculated and plotted using Isochor version 13/03/96 (Bakker, 1997) 
and Isoc version 01/03 (Bakker, 2003) utilizing the Bowers and Helgeson (1983) and Zhang and 
Frantz (1987) equations of state.

(1) aqueous inclusions 
Aqueous fluid inclusions are found as both isolated inclusions (Fig. 4A-B) and secondary planes 
(Fig. 4C). Initial melting of isolated inclusions at between -50 and -35 °C is interpreted to be 
eutectic melting. Eutectic melting temperatures of isolated inclusions indicate the presence of 
H2O-NaCl+MgCl2±CaCl2 (Goldstein and Reynolds, 1994). Isolated inclusions range in size 
between 12-30µm diameter, with 8-20% vapour. Final ice melting temperatures (Tm(ice)) for 
isolated inclusions range from -9.5°C to -21.1°C (Fig. 5A), corresponding to salinities of 
between 13.4 and 23.1 wt.% NaClequiv. Final homogenisation (Tht) was to the liquid phase 
ranging from 86 to 129°C (Fig. 5B). 
 
Aqueous fluid inclusions in trails and in planes contain 10-35% vapour. Initial melting of 
aqueous phases, interpreted as eutectic melting (Te), occurred between -55 and -23 °C, which 
corresponds to a composition of H2O-NaCl±CaCl2±MgCl2±KCl (Goldstein and Reynolds, 
1994). Tm(ice) for FIP’s ranges from -1.6 to -21.2 °C (Fig. 5A), indicating salinities between 2.7 
and 23.2 wt.% NaClequiv Total homogenisation (Tht) for FIP’s was always to the liquid phase, 
between 131 and 208 °C (Fig. 5B).

of aqueous isolated (primary) and trail (secondary) inclusions. B: Histogram showing the final 
homogenisation temperature (Tht in °C) distribution of all aqueous and aqueous carbonic 
inclusions.  
 
 
(2) aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
Several inclusions consist of mixed aqueous and non-aqueous phases. The non-aqueous 
components (carbonic) refer to CO2, CH4, N2, C2H6 and H2S. Isolated aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
(Fig. 4 D, H-I) range in size between 8-20µm, with between 10-60% vapour. This inclusion type 
also occurs as secondary trails (Fig. 4 E-G), with vapour phases ranging between 8 and 90 vol%. 
 
10

--- Page 14 ---
Melting of isolated carbonic phases (Tm(CO2)) are between -56.8 and -57.9 °C, and between -
58.7 and -56.9 °C for FIP’s (Fig. 6 A). Homogenisation of the carbonic components (Th(CO2)) in 
isolated inclusions was to the liquid phase at between 11.8 and 26.9 °C, and between 16.6 and 
30.8 °C for FIP’s (Fig. 6B). Total homogenisation temperatures (Tht) range between 128 and 245 
°C for FIP’s (Fig. 5B). Raman microspectrometry revealed the possible presence of magnesite 
(MgCO3) in one isolated inclusion (CBSqz3A(6)11) with Th(CO2) = 23.9°C. Carbonic phases of 
isolated inclusions consist of CO2 (determined with Raman spectroscopy) ranging between 98 
and >99.5 mol%, with N2 and CH4 comprising the remainder of the vapour. Carbonic phases in 
inclusions in FIP’s contain between 32 and >99.8 mol% CO2, <0.5 to 55.5 mol% N2, 0.3 to 35.5 
mol% CH4, and <0.1 mol% H2S (determined with Raman spectroscopy). Salinities for isolated 
inclusions range between 11.9 and 13.2 wt.% NaClequiv, and between 3.6 and 19.6 wt.% NaClequiv 
in FIP’s. Bulk densities range between 0.62 and 1.00 g/cm3.

phase. C: Distribution of homogenisation temperatures (ThCH4) methane inclusions in fluid

(3) Carbonic methane inclusions  
A distinctive population of fluid inclusion planes comprising numerous methane inclusions was 
identified, ranging in size between 7-16µm (Fig. 4 J-L). Th(CH4) was to the liquid phase at 
between -88.7 and -86.5 °C (Fig. 6C). Raman spectroscopy indicated the presence of between 
6.5 and 7 mol% N2 and between 0.5 and 1 mol% C2H6. The inclusions are classified according to 
their phase behaviour as H1-type inclusions with homogenisation as the final phase transition 
(Van den Kerkhof, 1990). 
 
INTERPRETATION OF FLUID TYPES 
 
Early fluids 
 
Isolated inclusions are interpreted as primary inclusions, and therefore represent a fluid that 
circulated early in the basin history. Salinities of primary aqueous and aqueo-carbonic inclusions 
range between 11.9 and 23.1 wt% NaClequiv (Fig. 7A), and final homogenisation temperatures 
range from 86 to 129°C. 
 
Low-temperature - high-salinity fluids may result from dissolution of evaporites, shale 
membrane filtration (Graf, 1982), or boiling of a lower salinity fluid. The effect of boiling, or 
effervescence, whereby the vapour of a high-density fluid is trapped as a low-density fluid 
(Roedder, 1984), was not observed in this study. The Katanga sequence hosts abundant 
evaporites in the upper Roan at Mufulira and Konkola, and within the lower Roan (Garlick, 
1974). Therefore, the high salinities and low trapping temperatures of isolated aqueous fluid 
inclusions in this study are best explained by the dissolution of evaporites by circulating connate 
fluids. 
 
Later fluids 
 
Secondary inclusions are interpreted to represent fluids that circulated later in the basin history 
and are characterised by two distinct salinity populations (Fig. 7), namely a low-salinity (~6 
wt.% NaClequiv), higher temperature (~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% 
NaClequiv), lower temperature (~130-160°C) group. The high-salinity group is considered to form 
from circulating basinal fluids that become increasingly saline and slightly hotter with 
progressive dissolution of evaporites. The presence of a later, low-salinity, but slightly hotter, 
fluid may best be explained by devolatilisation reactions during the onset of Lufilian regional 
metamorphism. Methane, also in secondary inclusion planes, is derived from the decomposition 
of hydrocarbon organic matter as it passes through the oil window (~60-150°C).

Figure 7:  A: Frequency vs salinity (wt.% NaClequiv) for all aqueous and aqueous-carbonic 
inclusions from isolated and trail populations show a large spread. B: Salinity (expressed in 
wt.% NaClequiv) vs homogenisation temperatures (Tht) to the liquid phase for primary (black 
diamonds) and secondary (white squares) aqueous inclusions. Secondary fluid inclusions show 
two groups in terms of salinity, namely a low-salinity (~6 wt.% NaClequiv) higher temperature 
(~140-210 °C) group, and a high-salinity (~18-23 wt.% NaClequiv) lower temperature (~130-
160°C) group. 
 
DISCUSSION 
 
Fluids that immediately post-date stratiform mineralisation are fairly homogeneous in 
composition and show moderate to high salinities (~12-23 wt.% NaClequiv). Conversely, later 
fluids exhibit a range in salinities (~6-23 wt.% NaClequiv), compositions, and trapping 
temperatures. Progressive sediment burial during diagenesis and the resultant heating of connate 
fluids is evident from Figure 7B, where an early high-salinity fluid evolves to a slightly higher 
temperature high-salinity fluid. As metamorphism increases, devolatilization reactions result in 
the production of a fluid of lower salinity, but at higher temperatures. 
 
Isochors plotted on a pressure-temperature diagram give an estimation of P-T conditions during 
fluid trapping (Roedder, 1984; Reynolds and Goldstein, 1994). Intersection of aqueous and 
carbonic isochors of homogeneously trapped inclusions constrains the range of P-T conditions 
applicable to the present study. Isochors for isolated aqueous inclusions were constructed for Tht 
ranging between 107 and 129°C, and for Tht ranging between 131 and 208°C for FIP’s. 
Intersection of aqueous and carbonic isochors in this study constrains the pressure and 
temperature of fluid inclusion trapping to around 480-800 bar and 130-270 °C (Fig. 8). These 
data reconstruct the pressure- and temperature conditions of the environment associated with 
(and immediately post-dating) stratiform copper mineralisation, prior to peak metamorphism.  
 
Previous P-T estimates for mineralising fluids by Kamona (1993), Richards et al. (1988a) and 
Speiser et al. (1995) are also plotted on Figure 8. The data by Kamona (1993) constrain the

characteristics of epigenetic carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralising fluids at Kabwe, a 
mineralisation style that post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation. These fluids are hotter than 
those detected in the present study. The data by Speiser et al. (1995) show the pressure and 
temperature ranges for conditions associated with epigenetic iron-oxide-copper-gold 
mineralisation to the northwest of the Copperbelt. This epigenetic-hydrothermal vein-style 
mineralisation (dated at ~503-512 Ma, Torrealday et al., 1999) post-dates earlier stratiform 
copper mineralisation and is considered coeval with the peak of regional metamorphism in the 
Lufilian arc. Pressures and temperatures associated with this style of mineralisation are 
substantially higher than those documented in this study (Fig. 8). Similarly, the data from 
Richards et al. (1988a) constrain the P-T conditions prevalent during late hydrothermal veining 
at the Musoshi deposit in the DRC, which is associated with alteration. This event of 
hydrothermal alteration, dated at ~514 Ma (Richards et al., 1988b), is related to peak Lufilian 
metamorphism and post-dates stratiform copper mineralisation. The range of temperatures 
attained by Richards et al. (1988a) also exceeds those obtained during this study, which 
constrains, for the first time, the characteristics of a late-diagenetic fluid associated with the 
environment of stratiform copper mineralisation in terms of composition, salinity, pressure and 
temperature. This study also documents the character of fluids that evolved subsequent to 
stratiform mineralisation, and which are associated with the onset of early metamorphism.  
 
 
 
Figure 8: Isochors of primary and secondary aqueous inclusions and methane FIP’s. Isochors 
of primary aqueous inclusions are indicated as dashed lines. Isochors for high salinity FIP’s are 
shown as solid black lines, and sold grey lines for low salinity FIPs. Isochors of methane FIP’s 
are shown as gently sloping solid black lines. Intersection of the aqueous and carbonic 
(methane) isochors constrain a P-T region of ~480-800 bar and ~130-270°C. Previous studies 
by Richards et al., (1988a) Speiser et al., (1995), and Kamona (1993) are shown. See text for
