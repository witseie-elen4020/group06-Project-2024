GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE NCHANGA GRANITE, AND CONSTRAINTS ON 
THE MAXIMUM AGE OF THE KATANGA SUPERGROUP, 
ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
The age of the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup, which hosts the stratiform Cu-Co 
deposits of the Central African Copperbelt, has not been well constrained. The Nchanga 
Granite, the youngest pre-Katangan intrusion in the Copperbelt basement, is non-conformably 
overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup, a relationship that is well exposed 
in the open pit at Nchanga mine, Zambia. Previous attempts at dating the Nchanga Granite 
using the K-Ar and Rb-Sr systems have given only younger Pan-African ages, reflecting 
resetting during regional metamorphism. Magmatic zircons extracted from this granite have 
been analysed by ion-microprobe and have yielded an age of 883 ± 10 Ma. Detrital zircons 
obtained from coarse-clastic sediments in the lower part of the Roan Group (at the base of the 
Katanga Supergroup), immediately above the non-conformity, cluster into 2 age populations, 
one at c. 880 Ma and the other at between 1800 and 2000 Ma. The Nchanga Granite age 
provides a reliable maximum estimate of the beginning of deposition of the Katanga 
Supergroup, or more specifically, of Roan Group deposition. The presence of Nchanga 
Granite-aged zircon detritus in the lower Roan sediments also indicates that sedimentation in 
the Central African Copperbelt did not commence until the Nchanga Granite had been 
exhumed and eroded. Our new maximum age for the Katanga Supergroup precludes its 
previous correlation with the c. 950 Ma Mbuji Mayi Group, and reinforces the likelihood of 
correlations with similar sequences in the Damara and West Congolian orogenic belts.

GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE NCHANGA GRANITE, AND CONSTRAINTS ON 
 THE MAXIMUM AGE OF THE KATANGA SUPERGROUP, 
 ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits, as 
well as numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe, etc., which constitute the Central African 
Copperbelt in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961). 
In spite of its great economic significance there are few age data relevant to the deposition of the 
Katanga Supergroup. The latter sequence was previously considered to have been deposited in late 
Mesoproterozoic times (Cahen et al., 1968, 1975, 1984), but this study shows unequivocally that it 
is much younger, with sedimentation having been initiated in the Neoproterozoic. 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
In the Central African Copperbelt, the oldest pre-Katangan basement consists of a 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc sequence, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex, comprising the 
Lufubu Schists and intrusive granitoids and gneisses, dated at between 1994 and 1873 Ma (Rainaud 
et al., 2005). The magmatic arc rocks, together with metasedimentary rocks of the flanking 
Ubendian Belt, were deformed and metamorphosed in the c. 2.0–1.8 Ga Ubendian Orogeny 
(Master, 1990; Lenoir et al., 1994). In the Zambian Copperbelt, the magmatic arc rocks are overlain 
unconformably by quartzitic and metapelitic metasediments of the Muva Group, which were 
deposited after 1941 Ma, based on the ages of detrital zircons (Rainaud et al., 2003). The Nchanga 
Granite is the youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement (Garlick and Brummer, 1951; 
Garlick, 1973), and it is nonconformably overlain by the Katangan Sequence, which consists of 
metasediments traditionally divided into the Roan and  Lower and Upper Kundelungu Supergroups 
(Cailteux et al., 1994; Francois, 1995). Distribution of the Nchanga Granite in the Zambian 
Copperbelt relative to Katangan sequences is illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
More recently, Wendorff (2001, 2003) and Master et al. (2005) have proposed a new 
lithostratigraphic scheme in which the Katanga Supergroup is subdivided into the Roan, Nguba and 
Kundelungu Groups, with two additional lithotectonic units, the Fungurume and Plateau Groups, 
which were deposited syntectonically in a foreland basin during deformation of the earlier 
Katangan groups during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. 
 
Rocks of the Katanga Supergroup were deformed and metamorphosed during the Lufilian (c. 600-
512 Ma) Orogeny (Cosi et al., 1992; Porada and Berhorst, 2000; Rainaud et al., 2002, 2005; John et 
al., 2003, 2004), while supposedly correlative lithologies in the Zambezi Belt were also deformed 
and metamorphosed during the Lusakan (c. 840 Ma) Orogeny (Hanson et al., 1994). The 
depositional age and duration of the Roan Group has been very poorly constrained, with the 
available data suggesting a range between c. 1200 and 870 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984). Kampunzu and 
Cailteux (1999) suggested a maximum age of 980 Ma for the Katanga Supergroup, based on the 
presence in basal Katangan conglomerates of pebbles of c. 980 Ma Kibaran tin granites (Madi, 
1985), as well as of detrital cassiterite in lowermost Roan sediments (Jedwab, 1997). The minimum 
age of the entire Katanga Supergroup was established by Cahen (1973) at 620 Ma, based on U-Pb 
dating of post-Kundelungu uraninite veins. However, more recent dating of detrital muscovites 
from the Kundelungu Plateau give a maximum age of 573 ± 5 Ma for the uppermost Katangan 
sediments of the Plateau Group, which were deposited in a foreland basin during the Lufilian 
Orogeny (Master et al., 2005).

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 
 
In this study a population of zircons was obtained from the Nchanga Granite (pink variety), which 
was sampled in borehole P322, drilled in the underground section of Nchanga Mine, where it is 
nonconformably overlain by coarse clastic sediments of the lower Roan Group (Table 1). Suites of 
detrital zircons were extracted from crossbedded Roan arkoses and sandstones sampled at 6 and 23 
metres above the contact with the Nchanga Granite in the same borehole (P322) drilled at Nchanga 
Mine from which the granite sample was obtained (Table 1). The separation of zircons was 
performed at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, using 
conventional techniques. The separated zircons were examined and characterised using 
cathodoluminescence imagery. All zircons were analysed randomly. U-Pb analyses were performed 
on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP II) at the Research School of Earth 
Sciences, Australian National University. The SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is 
similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). Age calculations and plotting were carried 
out using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) and all ages are quoted with errors at the 1σ level. The zircons 
show typically magmatic features such as oscillatory zoning and euhedral outlines, with no cores.

NCHANGA GRANITE 
 
The youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement is the Nchanga Granite, which is an 
unfoliated, coarse-grained, peraluminous biotitic alkali granite with A-type geochemical 
characteristics (Cahen et al., 1970b; Tembo et al., 2000). The Nchanga Granite has red and grey 
varieties (O’Meara, 1959; in McKinnon and Smit, 1961), and is cut by thin aplite dykes, which are 
regarded as the final phase of a composite intrusion. A maximum age limit on the Katanga 
Supergroup would be the age of the Nchanga Granite, which has provided detritus in the form of 
granitic pebbles and zircons in the overlying Roan sediments (Binda, 1972; Garlick, 1973; 
Fleischer et al., 1976). 
 
Many previous attempts at dating the Nchanga Granite have yielded unsatisfactory results. An age 
of 490 ± 20 Ma based on K-Ar dating of biotite probably reflects resetting during the Lufilian 
Orogeny (Snelling et al., 1964). Whole rock Rb-Sr dating gave an age of 604 ± 40 Ma, while Rb-Sr 
dating of whole rock powders and mineral separates from the Nchanga Granite gave isochron ages 
of c. 500 to 455 Ma, again reflecting a younger resetting event, possibly during the waning stages 
of the Lufilian Orogeny (Snelling et al., 1964; Drysdall and Garrard, 1964; Armstrong et al., 1999). 
The first attempt at U-Pb dating of zircons from the Nchanga Granite was made by Cahen et al. 
(1970b), who obtained two discordant multi-grain zircon fractions with very different 207Pb/206Pb 
ages of 710 Ma and 551 Ma. Using the assumption that these zircons contained common lead with 
the isotopic composition of Copperbelt galena leads, Cahen et al. (1970b) obtained a model age of 
c. 600 Ma for the Nchanga Granite. Further interpretations of the discordant zircons ages of Cahen 
et al. (1970b), led Cahen (1975) to propose a possible upper intercept concordia age of 960 Ma 
(recalculated by Cahen et al., 1984, as 954 Ma). Cahen et al. (1984) quoted unpublished data from 
Binda, which indicated an imprecise Pb-Pb age of 1100–1200 Ma for the Nchanga Granite. 
Palaeomagnetic results from the grey and pink varieties of the Nchanga Granite were interpreted 
geochronologically by comparison with the Neoproterozoic polar wander path for southern Africa 
(Thomson and Sweeney, 1995). The Nchanga Grey Granite gave an age of 1200-1100 Ma, while 
the Nchanga Pink Granite gave an age of between 700 and 600 Ma (Thomson and Sweeney, 1995). 
However, palaeomagnetic results similar to those from both varieties of Nchanga Granite were also 
obtained from the overlying Roan Group sediments (Thomson and Sweeney, 1995), hence the age 
interpretations cannot be correct, and the palaeomagnetic poles represent some kind of magnetic 
overprint whose significance is unclear.

A hand-picked suite of 13 magmatic zircons (free of fractures and inclusions) was analysed and the 
results are listed in Table 2 and plotted on a concordia diagram in Figure 2. The analyses plot in a 
single cluster and no xenocrysts were detected in the present sample set. The weighted mean 
207Pb/206Pb age of all analysed zircons yields an age of 883 ± 10 Ma with MSWD = 0.12. This is 
interpreted as the emplacement age of this phase of the Nchanga Granite.

KATANGA SUPERGROUP- LOWER ROAN GROUP SEDIMENTS 
 
Conglomeratic and arkosic sediments of the siliciclastic unit in the lower Roan Group at Nchanga 
Mine nonconformably overlie the Nchanga Granite, a relationship that is well exposed in the 
Nchanga open pit (Fig. 3). Previous studies have indicated that there are pebbles and zircons from 
the Nchanga Granite in basal Roan conglomerates, suggesting that the lower Roan sediments are 
derived by erosion of a proximal basement that included the Nchanga Granite (Binda, 1972; 
Garlick, 1973). Despite the overwhelming field evidence for an unconformable contact between the 
Nchanga Granite and the Roan sediments, there have been attempts to argue that the granite was 
intrusive into Roan sediments. Such attempts (e.g., by Gysin, 1960), were based on the intersection 
of supposed dykes of granite within the Roan sediments. However, it was shown by Garlick (1973) 
and by Fleischer et al. (1976) that these supposed dykes were exfoliated slabs of granite near the 
unconformity surface, or large boulders of granite intersected in drill core, and mistaken for dykes.

conglomerate containing large boulders of Nchanga Granite (above the hammer head and dashed 
line), overlain by coarse-grained arkose. Exposure in the Nchanga open pit.  
 
 
U-Pb SHRIMP dating of these lower Roan Group detrital zircons, from both the arkose and the 
feldspathic sandstone (samples 2 and 1 respectively), using the same procedures as those applicable 
to the Nchanga Granite, reveals two distinct age populations (Table 3 and Fig. 4a,b), one at 
between 2000 to 1800 Ma (corresponding to the range of ages in the adjacent Palaeoproterozoic 

--- Page 10 ---

Lufubu Metamorphic Complex basement; Rainaud et al., 2005), and the other at around 880 Ma 
(corresponding to the age of the Nchanga Granite presented above). This demonstrates that the 
Nchanga Granite provided detritus to the Lower Roan, and had been unroofed by the time 
deposition in the Katangan basin commenced. It sets an unequivocal lower limit of 880 Ma for the 
age of the Katanga Supergroup. The poorly sorted, coarse clastic, lower Roan sediments were 
derived from a proximal provenance that comprised both the 880 Ma Nchanga Granite as well as 
the Palaeoproterozoic Lufubu basement. 
 
INTRUSIVE DYKES IN LOWER ROAN GROUP SEDIMENTS 
 
At least three intrusive rocks cut lower Roan Group sediments exposed in the Nchanga open pit. 
Felsic dykes cut meta-arkoses in borehole NOP-589 and also intrude schistose siliciclastic 
metasediments in borehole NOP-681. These dykes contain zircons, but SHRIMP U-Pb analysis 
indicates that all are xenocrystic and derived from the local basement. Additional analyses of rutile 
and sphene from these dykes are the object of a current study that will further constrain the 
minimum ages of both the Roan Group as well as the stratiform Cu-Co mineralization within it 
(Robb et al., in prep.).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
The 883 ± 10 Ma age of the Nchanga Granite sets a considerably younger new maximum age for 
the Katanga Supergroup. This age is indistinguishable from the 879 ± 16 Ma age of the Kafue 
Rhyolite, which is at the base of supposed Katangan-equivalent supracrustals of the Zambezi Belt 
(Hanson et al., 1994). This event suggests that felsic magmatism occurred just prior to, or during, 
the early rifting stages of Katangan basin formation (Armstrong et al., 1999). This view would best 
be compatible with a scenario in which the Katangan rifts were limited in extent and formed in 
response to the rifting of a composite terrane consisting of both the Kalahari and Congo Cratons 
(e.g., Master, 1990, 1993; Hanson, 2003). Recently published data on MORB-type eclogites in the 
Zambezi Belt (John et al., 2003), however, give an age of c. 590 Ma for eclogite formation at high 
pressures (up to 23 kb), and suggest the presence of a wide ocean basin (>1000 km), which closed 
by subduction of oceanic crust to depths of >90 km, prior to exhumation. Furthermore, high-
pressure talc-kyanite white schists from the Lufilian Arc and the Zambezi Belt record metamorphic 
ages on monazite of c. 530 Ma (John et al., 2004). The Zambezi Belt could, therefore, be 
interpreted as a collisional suture between two widely separated cratons (the Congo and Kalahari), 
so that rocks such as the Nchanga Granite on the Congo Craton cannot be genetically related to 
similar aged units in the Zambezi Belt, which were on the northern edge of the Kalahari Craton. 
Furthermore, the interpretation of the Zambezi Belt supracrustals, which include the Makuti Group 
of NW Zimbabwe, as a bimodal rift sequence (Munyanyiwa et al., 1997), has been questioned by 
Dirks et al. (1999) who showed that rocks described as “meta-arkoses” (Broderick, 1976) and 
“meta-rhyolites” (Munyanyiwa et al., 1997) are, in fact, sheared granites.  The age of the Nchanga 
Granite is similar to, but slightly older than, those of the Lusaka Granite (842 ± 33 Ma; recalculated 
from Barr et al., 1978), the Ngoma Gneiss in the Zambezi Belt (820 ± 7 Ma; Hanson et al., 1988), 
and a megacrystic granite dated at 852 ± 11 Ma in the Tsumkwe area near the southern edge of the 
Congo Craton (Hoal et al., 2000). Our preferred interpretation, therefore, is that the granitoids and 
felsic volcanics of the Zambezi Belt in SW Zambia were probably on an entirely different crustal 
fragment or continent at this time and should not be correlated with the Nchanga Granite. The latter 
remains the only known granitic intrusion of Neoproterozoic age in the Copperbelt region. 
 
The felsic dykes at Nchanga contain xenocrystic zircons sourced from the Proterozoic basement of 
the Central African Copperbelt (Rainaud et al., 2005). These dykes cut across Roan Group 
sediments and probably represent the feeders to sills (Tembo et al., 1999) and extrusive lavas 
higher  in the Katangan  succession, such  as the  760 ± 5 Ma  Lwavu  volcanics in western  Zambia

(Key et al., 2001). These volcanics are located within the Mwashya Subgroup, which 
stratigraphically overlies the Roan Group. Additional evidence for magmatic activity at this period 
is present in the form of the gabbroic intrusions within Katangan carbonate sediments of the 
Solwezi area, NW Zambia, which have yielded ages of 745 ± 7.8 Ma and 752.6 ± 8.6 Ma (Barron 
et al., 2003). These ages collectively constrain deposition of the Roan and Mwashya sediments to 
the interval between 880 and 760 Ma. Cahen et al. (1970a, 1984) reported the ages of two 
metamorphic microcline veins cutting the Roan Group at Luanshya and Musoshi, as being 840 ± 42 
Ma, hence setting a younger limit to the age of the Roan Group. However, we regard these Rb/Sr 
model ages to be unreliable, hence 880 Ma remains the most reliable maximum age of the Katanga 
Supergroup. This new maximum age precludes a suggested correlation of the Katangan with the 
older (948 ± 15 Ma) Bushimay or Mbuji Mayi Supergroup in the Congo (Cahen et al., 1984), but 
reinforces the likelihood of correlations with similar sequences within the Damaran and West 
Congolian orogenic belts (Miller, 1983; Tack et al., 2001). 
 
Whereas previously they were thought to reflect diachronous basin development spanning several 
hundred million years (Porada, 1989), the Katanga and Damara Supergroups are now regarded as 
part of a single episode of rifting and passive margin formation, followed by later subduction and 
continental collision, on the southern margin of the greater Congo Craton (Master, 2004; Rainaud 
et al., 2005). The mafic lavas and gabbroic intrusions in the Mwashya Subgroup, which range in 
age between 760 ± 5 Ma and 745 ± 7.8 Ma, have the same range of ages as felsic volcanics and 
intrusive syenites from the Damara Supergroup, in the Summas Mountains of northern Namibia 
(Hoffman et al., 1996). In the Summas Mountains, the basal Damaran rocks consist of a continental 
succession of feldspathic sandstones and conglomerates of the Nosib Group, which record 
continental rifting in the southern margin of the Congo Craton (Hoffmann, 1994). The Nosib Group 
is  overlain here by the Ugab Subgroup, a mixed association of syn- to post-extensional carbonates 
and terrigenous sedimentary rocks (Miller, 1980). In  the Damara Supergroup, a felsic ash-flow tuff

from the Naauwpoort Formation of the upper Nosib Group and a rhyolite from the lower Ugab 
Subgroup have yielded indistinguishable U-Pb zircon ages of 746 ± 2 and 747 ± 2 Ma, respectively 
(Hoffman et al., 1996). The Oas quartz syenite, which intrudes the lower Nosib Group, has been 
dated at 756 ± 2 Ma (Hoffman et al., 1996) and, hence, the lowermost Nosib Group, at the base of 
the Damara Supergroup, is older than this. Because the pre-Damaran basement in the southern 
Congo Craton is of Palaeoproterozoic (c. 2000 to 1800 Ma) age (Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985), the 
age of the lowermost Damaran sediments is not well constrained. The age equivalence of intrusive 
and extrusive rocks in the Mwashya Subgroup, and of the intrusive and extrusive Damaran rocks of 
the Summas Mountains suggests a correlation between the Mwashya Subgroup and the 
Naauwpoort Group and lower Ugab Subgroups. This also suggests a correlation between the pre-
Mwashya Roan Group, and the lowermost Nosib Group. The maximum age of 880 Ma for the

Roan Group obtained in this paper may also, therefore, represent a maximum age for the Nosib 
Group at the base of the Damara Supergroup.

GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE NCHANGA GRANITE, AND CONSTRAINTS ON 
THE MAXIMUM AGE OF THE KATANGA SUPERGROUP, 
ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
The age of the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup, which hosts the stratiform Cu-Co 
deposits of the Central African Copperbelt, has not been well constrained. The Nchanga 
Granite, the youngest pre-Katangan intrusion in the Copperbelt basement, is non-conformably 
overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup, a relationship that is well exposed 
in the open pit at Nchanga mine, Zambia. Previous attempts at dating the Nchanga Granite 
using the K-Ar and Rb-Sr systems have given only younger Pan-African ages, reflecting 
resetting during regional metamorphism. Magmatic zircons extracted from this granite have 
been analysed by ion-microprobe and have yielded an age of 883 ± 10 Ma. Detrital zircons 
obtained from coarse-clastic sediments in the lower part of the Roan Group (at the base of the 
Katanga Supergroup), immediately above the non-conformity, cluster into 2 age populations, 
one at c. 880 Ma and the other at between 1800 and 2000 Ma. The Nchanga Granite age 
provides a reliable maximum estimate of the beginning of deposition of the Katanga 
Supergroup, or more specifically, of Roan Group deposition. The presence of Nchanga 
Granite-aged zircon detritus in the lower Roan sediments also indicates that sedimentation in 
the Central African Copperbelt did not commence until the Nchanga Granite had been 
exhumed and eroded. Our new maximum age for the Katanga Supergroup precludes its 
previous correlation with the c. 950 Ma Mbuji Mayi Group, and reinforces the likelihood of 
correlations with similar sequences in the Damara and West Congolian orogenic belts.

GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE NCHANGA GRANITE, AND CONSTRAINTS ON 
 THE MAXIMUM AGE OF THE KATANGA SUPERGROUP, 
 ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits, as 
well as numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe, etc., which constitute the Central African 
Copperbelt in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961). 
In spite of its great economic significance there are few age data relevant to the deposition of the 
Katanga Supergroup. The latter sequence was previously considered to have been deposited in late 
Mesoproterozoic times (Cahen et al., 1968, 1975, 1984), but this study shows unequivocally that it 
is much younger, with sedimentation having been initiated in the Neoproterozoic. 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
In the Central African Copperbelt, the oldest pre-Katangan basement consists of a 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc sequence, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex, comprising the 
Lufubu Schists and intrusive granitoids and gneisses, dated at between 1994 and 1873 Ma (Rainaud 
et al., 2005). The magmatic arc rocks, together with metasedimentary rocks of the flanking 
Ubendian Belt, were deformed and metamorphosed in the c. 2.0–1.8 Ga Ubendian Orogeny 
(Master, 1990; Lenoir et al., 1994). In the Zambian Copperbelt, the magmatic arc rocks are overlain 
unconformably by quartzitic and metapelitic metasediments of the Muva Group, which were 
deposited after 1941 Ma, based on the ages of detrital zircons (Rainaud et al., 2003). The Nchanga 
Granite is the youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement (Garlick and Brummer, 1951; 
Garlick, 1973), and it is nonconformably overlain by the Katangan Sequence, which consists of 
metasediments traditionally divided into the Roan and  Lower and Upper Kundelungu Supergroups 
(Cailteux et al., 1994; Francois, 1995). Distribution of the Nchanga Granite in the Zambian 
Copperbelt relative to Katangan sequences is illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
More recently, Wendorff (2001, 2003) and Master et al. (2005) have proposed a new 
lithostratigraphic scheme in which the Katanga Supergroup is subdivided into the Roan, Nguba and 
Kundelungu Groups, with two additional lithotectonic units, the Fungurume and Plateau Groups, 
which were deposited syntectonically in a foreland basin during deformation of the earlier 
Katangan groups during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. 
 
Rocks of the Katanga Supergroup were deformed and metamorphosed during the Lufilian (c. 600-
512 Ma) Orogeny (Cosi et al., 1992; Porada and Berhorst, 2000; Rainaud et al., 2002, 2005; John et 
al., 2003, 2004), while supposedly correlative lithologies in the Zambezi Belt were also deformed 
and metamorphosed during the Lusakan (c. 840 Ma) Orogeny (Hanson et al., 1994). The 
depositional age and duration of the Roan Group has been very poorly constrained, with the 
available data suggesting a range between c. 1200 and 870 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984). Kampunzu and 
Cailteux (1999) suggested a maximum age of 980 Ma for the Katanga Supergroup, based on the 
presence in basal Katangan conglomerates of pebbles of c. 980 Ma Kibaran tin granites (Madi, 
1985), as well as of detrital cassiterite in lowermost Roan sediments (Jedwab, 1997). The minimum 
age of the entire Katanga Supergroup was established by Cahen (1973) at 620 Ma, based on U-Pb 
dating of post-Kundelungu uraninite veins. However, more recent dating of detrital muscovites 
from the Kundelungu Plateau give a maximum age of 573 ± 5 Ma for the uppermost Katangan 
sediments of the Plateau Group, which were deposited in a foreland basin during the Lufilian 
Orogeny (Master et al., 2005).

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 
 
In this study a population of zircons was obtained from the Nchanga Granite (pink variety), which 
was sampled in borehole P322, drilled in the underground section of Nchanga Mine, where it is 
nonconformably overlain by coarse clastic sediments of the lower Roan Group (Table 1). Suites of 
detrital zircons were extracted from crossbedded Roan arkoses and sandstones sampled at 6 and 23 
metres above the contact with the Nchanga Granite in the same borehole (P322) drilled at Nchanga 
Mine from which the granite sample was obtained (Table 1). The separation of zircons was 
performed at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, using 
conventional techniques. The separated zircons were examined and characterised using 
cathodoluminescence imagery. All zircons were analysed randomly. U-Pb analyses were performed 
on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP II) at the Research School of Earth 
Sciences, Australian National University. The SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is 
similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). Age calculations and plotting were carried 
out using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) and all ages are quoted with errors at the 1σ level. The zircons 
show typically magmatic features such as oscillatory zoning and euhedral outlines, with no cores.

NCHANGA GRANITE 
 
The youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement is the Nchanga Granite, which is an 
unfoliated, coarse-grained, peraluminous biotitic alkali granite with A-type geochemical 
characteristics (Cahen et al., 1970b; Tembo et al., 2000). The Nchanga Granite has red and grey 
varieties (O’Meara, 1959; in McKinnon and Smit, 1961), and is cut by thin aplite dykes, which are 
regarded as the final phase of a composite intrusion. A maximum age limit on the Katanga 
Supergroup would be the age of the Nchanga Granite, which has provided detritus in the form of 
granitic pebbles and zircons in the overlying Roan sediments (Binda, 1972; Garlick, 1973; 
Fleischer et al., 1976). 
 
Many previous attempts at dating the Nchanga Granite have yielded unsatisfactory results. An age 
of 490 ± 20 Ma based on K-Ar dating of biotite probably reflects resetting during the Lufilian 
Orogeny (Snelling et al., 1964). Whole rock Rb-Sr dating gave an age of 604 ± 40 Ma, while Rb-Sr 
dating of whole rock powders and mineral separates from the Nchanga Granite gave isochron ages 
of c. 500 to 455 Ma, again reflecting a younger resetting event, possibly during the waning stages 
of the Lufilian Orogeny (Snelling et al., 1964; Drysdall and Garrard, 1964; Armstrong et al., 1999). 
The first attempt at U-Pb dating of zircons from the Nchanga Granite was made by Cahen et al. 
(1970b), who obtained two discordant multi-grain zircon fractions with very different 207Pb/206Pb 
ages of 710 Ma and 551 Ma. Using the assumption that these zircons contained common lead with 
the isotopic composition of Copperbelt galena leads, Cahen et al. (1970b) obtained a model age of 
c. 600 Ma for the Nchanga Granite. Further interpretations of the discordant zircons ages of Cahen 
et al. (1970b), led Cahen (1975) to propose a possible upper intercept concordia age of 960 Ma 
(recalculated by Cahen et al., 1984, as 954 Ma). Cahen et al. (1984) quoted unpublished data from 
Binda, which indicated an imprecise Pb-Pb age of 1100–1200 Ma for the Nchanga Granite. 
Palaeomagnetic results from the grey and pink varieties of the Nchanga Granite were interpreted 
geochronologically by comparison with the Neoproterozoic polar wander path for southern Africa 
(Thomson and Sweeney, 1995). The Nchanga Grey Granite gave an age of 1200-1100 Ma, while 
the Nchanga Pink Granite gave an age of between 700 and 600 Ma (Thomson and Sweeney, 1995). 
However, palaeomagnetic results similar to those from both varieties of Nchanga Granite were also 
obtained from the overlying Roan Group sediments (Thomson and Sweeney, 1995), hence the age 
interpretations cannot be correct, and the palaeomagnetic poles represent some kind of magnetic 
overprint whose significance is unclear.

A hand-picked suite of 13 magmatic zircons (free of fractures and inclusions) was analysed and the 
results are listed in Table 2 and plotted on a concordia diagram in Figure 2. The analyses plot in a 
single cluster and no xenocrysts were detected in the present sample set. The weighted mean 
207Pb/206Pb age of all analysed zircons yields an age of 883 ± 10 Ma with MSWD = 0.12. This is 
interpreted as the emplacement age of this phase of the Nchanga Granite.

KATANGA SUPERGROUP- LOWER ROAN GROUP SEDIMENTS 
 
Conglomeratic and arkosic sediments of the siliciclastic unit in the lower Roan Group at Nchanga 
Mine nonconformably overlie the Nchanga Granite, a relationship that is well exposed in the 
Nchanga open pit (Fig. 3). Previous studies have indicated that there are pebbles and zircons from 
the Nchanga Granite in basal Roan conglomerates, suggesting that the lower Roan sediments are 
derived by erosion of a proximal basement that included the Nchanga Granite (Binda, 1972; 
Garlick, 1973). Despite the overwhelming field evidence for an unconformable contact between the 
Nchanga Granite and the Roan sediments, there have been attempts to argue that the granite was 
intrusive into Roan sediments. Such attempts (e.g., by Gysin, 1960), were based on the intersection 
of supposed dykes of granite within the Roan sediments. However, it was shown by Garlick (1973) 
and by Fleischer et al. (1976) that these supposed dykes were exfoliated slabs of granite near the 
unconformity surface, or large boulders of granite intersected in drill core, and mistaken for dykes.

U-Pb SHRIMP dating of these lower Roan Group detrital zircons, from both the arkose and the 
feldspathic sandstone (samples 2 and 1 respectively), using the same procedures as those applicable 
to the Nchanga Granite, reveals two distinct age populations (Table 3 and Fig. 4a,b), one at 
between 2000 to 1800 Ma (corresponding to the range of ages in the adjacent Palaeoproterozoic

Lufubu Metamorphic Complex basement; Rainaud et al., 2005), and the other at around 880 Ma 
(corresponding to the age of the Nchanga Granite presented above). This demonstrates that the 
Nchanga Granite provided detritus to the Lower Roan, and had been unroofed by the time 
deposition in the Katangan basin commenced. It sets an unequivocal lower limit of 880 Ma for the 
age of the Katanga Supergroup. The poorly sorted, coarse clastic, lower Roan sediments were 
derived from a proximal provenance that comprised both the 880 Ma Nchanga Granite as well as 
the Palaeoproterozoic Lufubu basement. 
 
INTRUSIVE DYKES IN LOWER ROAN GROUP SEDIMENTS 
 
At least three intrusive rocks cut lower Roan Group sediments exposed in the Nchanga open pit. 
Felsic dykes cut meta-arkoses in borehole NOP-589 and also intrude schistose siliciclastic 
metasediments in borehole NOP-681. These dykes contain zircons, but SHRIMP U-Pb analysis 
indicates that all are xenocrystic and derived from the local basement. Additional analyses of rutile 
and sphene from these dykes are the object of a current study that will further constrain the 
minimum ages of both the Roan Group as well as the stratiform Cu-Co mineralization within it 
(Robb et al., in prep.).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
The 883 ± 10 Ma age of the Nchanga Granite sets a considerably younger new maximum age for 
the Katanga Supergroup. This age is indistinguishable from the 879 ± 16 Ma age of the Kafue 
Rhyolite, which is at the base of supposed Katangan-equivalent supracrustals of the Zambezi Belt 
(Hanson et al., 1994). This event suggests that felsic magmatism occurred just prior to, or during, 
the early rifting stages of Katangan basin formation (Armstrong et al., 1999). This view would best 
be compatible with a scenario in which the Katangan rifts were limited in extent and formed in 
response to the rifting of a composite terrane consisting of both the Kalahari and Congo Cratons 
(e.g., Master, 1990, 1993; Hanson, 2003). Recently published data on MORB-type eclogites in the 
Zambezi Belt (John et al., 2003), however, give an age of c. 590 Ma for eclogite formation at high 
pressures (up to 23 kb), and suggest the presence of a wide ocean basin (>1000 km), which closed 
by subduction of oceanic crust to depths of >90 km, prior to exhumation. Furthermore, high-
pressure talc-kyanite white schists from the Lufilian Arc and the Zambezi Belt record metamorphic 
ages on monazite of c. 530 Ma (John et al., 2004). The Zambezi Belt could, therefore, be 
interpreted as a collisional suture between two widely separated cratons (the Congo and Kalahari), 
so that rocks such as the Nchanga Granite on the Congo Craton cannot be genetically related to 
similar aged units in the Zambezi Belt, which were on the northern edge of the Kalahari Craton. 
Furthermore, the interpretation of the Zambezi Belt supracrustals, which include the Makuti Group 
of NW Zimbabwe, as a bimodal rift sequence (Munyanyiwa et al., 1997), has been questioned by 
Dirks et al. (1999) who showed that rocks described as “meta-arkoses” (Broderick, 1976) and 
“meta-rhyolites” (Munyanyiwa et al., 1997) are, in fact, sheared granites.  The age of the Nchanga 
Granite is similar to, but slightly older than, those of the Lusaka Granite (842 ± 33 Ma; recalculated 
from Barr et al., 1978), the Ngoma Gneiss in the Zambezi Belt (820 ± 7 Ma; Hanson et al., 1988), 
and a megacrystic granite dated at 852 ± 11 Ma in the Tsumkwe area near the southern edge of the 
Congo Craton (Hoal et al., 2000). Our preferred interpretation, therefore, is that the granitoids and 
felsic volcanics of the Zambezi Belt in SW Zambia were probably on an entirely different crustal 
fragment or continent at this time and should not be correlated with the Nchanga Granite. The latter 
remains the only known granitic intrusion of Neoproterozoic age in the Copperbelt region. 
 
The felsic dykes at Nchanga contain xenocrystic zircons sourced from the Proterozoic basement of 
the Central African Copperbelt (Rainaud et al., 2005). These dykes cut across Roan Group 
sediments and probably represent the feeders to sills (Tembo et al., 1999) and extrusive lavas 
higher  in the Katangan  succession, such  as the  760 ± 5 Ma  Lwavu  volcanics in western  Zambia

(Key et al., 2001). These volcanics are located within the Mwashya Subgroup, which 
stratigraphically overlies the Roan Group. Additional evidence for magmatic activity at this period 
is present in the form of the gabbroic intrusions within Katangan carbonate sediments of the 
Solwezi area, NW Zambia, which have yielded ages of 745 ± 7.8 Ma and 752.6 ± 8.6 Ma (Barron 
et al., 2003). These ages collectively constrain deposition of the Roan and Mwashya sediments to 
the interval between 880 and 760 Ma. Cahen et al. (1970a, 1984) reported the ages of two 
metamorphic microcline veins cutting the Roan Group at Luanshya and Musoshi, as being 840 ± 42 
Ma, hence setting a younger limit to the age of the Roan Group. However, we regard these Rb/Sr 
model ages to be unreliable, hence 880 Ma remains the most reliable maximum age of the Katanga 
Supergroup. This new maximum age precludes a suggested correlation of the Katangan with the 
older (948 ± 15 Ma) Bushimay or Mbuji Mayi Supergroup in the Congo (Cahen et al., 1984), but 
reinforces the likelihood of correlations with similar sequences within the Damaran and West 
Congolian orogenic belts (Miller, 1983; Tack et al., 2001). 
 
Whereas previously they were thought to reflect diachronous basin development spanning several 
hundred million years (Porada, 1989), the Katanga and Damara Supergroups are now regarded as 
part of a single episode of rifting and passive margin formation, followed by later subduction and 
continental collision, on the southern margin of the greater Congo Craton (Master, 2004; Rainaud 
et al., 2005). The mafic lavas and gabbroic intrusions in the Mwashya Subgroup, which range in 
age between 760 ± 5 Ma and 745 ± 7.8 Ma, have the same range of ages as felsic volcanics and 
intrusive syenites from the Damara Supergroup, in the Summas Mountains of northern Namibia 
(Hoffman et al., 1996). In the Summas Mountains, the basal Damaran rocks consist of a continental 
succession of feldspathic sandstones and conglomerates of the Nosib Group, which record 
continental rifting in the southern margin of the Congo Craton (Hoffmann, 1994). The Nosib Group 
is  overlain here by the Ugab Subgroup, a mixed association of syn- to post-extensional carbonates 
and terrigenous sedimentary rocks (Miller, 1980). In  the Damara Supergroup, a felsic ash-flow tuff

from the Naauwpoort Formation of the upper Nosib Group and a rhyolite from the lower Ugab 
Subgroup have yielded indistinguishable U-Pb zircon ages of 746 ± 2 and 747 ± 2 Ma, respectively 
(Hoffman et al., 1996). The Oas quartz syenite, which intrudes the lower Nosib Group, has been 
dated at 756 ± 2 Ma (Hoffman et al., 1996) and, hence, the lowermost Nosib Group, at the base of 
the Damara Supergroup, is older than this. Because the pre-Damaran basement in the southern 
Congo Craton is of Palaeoproterozoic (c. 2000 to 1800 Ma) age (Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985), the 
age of the lowermost Damaran sediments is not well constrained. The age equivalence of intrusive 
and extrusive rocks in the Mwashya Subgroup, and of the intrusive and extrusive Damaran rocks of 
the Summas Mountains suggests a correlation between the Mwashya Subgroup and the 
Naauwpoort Group and lower Ugab Subgroups. This also suggests a correlation between the pre-
Mwashya Roan Group, and the lowermost Nosib Group. The maximum age of 880 Ma for the

Roan Group obtained in this paper may also, therefore, represent a maximum age for the Nosib 
Group at the base of the Damara Supergroup.

GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE NCHANGA GRANITE, AND CONSTRAINTS ON 
THE MAXIMUM AGE OF THE KATANGA SUPERGROUP, 
ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
The age of the Neoproterozoic Katanga Supergroup, which hosts the stratiform Cu-Co 
deposits of the Central African Copperbelt, has not been well constrained. The Nchanga 
Granite, the youngest pre-Katangan intrusion in the Copperbelt basement, is non-conformably 
overlain by sedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup, a relationship that is well exposed 
in the open pit at Nchanga mine, Zambia. Previous attempts at dating the Nchanga Granite 
using the K-Ar and Rb-Sr systems have given only younger Pan-African ages, reflecting 
resetting during regional metamorphism. Magmatic zircons extracted from this granite have 
been analysed by ion-microprobe and have yielded an age of 883 ± 10 Ma. Detrital zircons 
obtained from coarse-clastic sediments in the lower part of the Roan Group (at the base of the 
Katanga Supergroup), immediately above the non-conformity, cluster into 2 age populations, 
one at c. 880 Ma and the other at between 1800 and 2000 Ma. The Nchanga Granite age 
provides a reliable maximum estimate of the beginning of deposition of the Katanga 
Supergroup, or more specifically, of Roan Group deposition. The presence of Nchanga 
Granite-aged zircon detritus in the lower Roan sediments also indicates that sedimentation in 
the Central African Copperbelt did not commence until the Nchanga Granite had been 
exhumed and eroded. Our new maximum age for the Katanga Supergroup precludes its 
previous correlation with the c. 950 Ma Mbuji Mayi Group, and reinforces the likelihood of 
correlations with similar sequences in the Damara and West Congolian orogenic belts.

GEOCHRONOLOGY OF THE NCHANGA GRANITE, AND CONSTRAINTS ON 
 THE MAXIMUM AGE OF THE KATANGA SUPERGROUP, 
 ZAMBIAN COPPERBELT 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits, as 
well as numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe, etc., which constitute the Central African 
Copperbelt in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961). 
In spite of its great economic significance there are few age data relevant to the deposition of the 
Katanga Supergroup. The latter sequence was previously considered to have been deposited in late 
Mesoproterozoic times (Cahen et al., 1968, 1975, 1984), but this study shows unequivocally that it 
is much younger, with sedimentation having been initiated in the Neoproterozoic. 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING 
 
In the Central African Copperbelt, the oldest pre-Katangan basement consists of a 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc sequence, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex, comprising the 
Lufubu Schists and intrusive granitoids and gneisses, dated at between 1994 and 1873 Ma (Rainaud 
et al., 2005). The magmatic arc rocks, together with metasedimentary rocks of the flanking 
Ubendian Belt, were deformed and metamorphosed in the c. 2.0–1.8 Ga Ubendian Orogeny 
(Master, 1990; Lenoir et al., 1994). In the Zambian Copperbelt, the magmatic arc rocks are overlain 
unconformably by quartzitic and metapelitic metasediments of the Muva Group, which were 
deposited after 1941 Ma, based on the ages of detrital zircons (Rainaud et al., 2003). The Nchanga 
Granite is the youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement (Garlick and Brummer, 1951; 
Garlick, 1973), and it is nonconformably overlain by the Katangan Sequence, which consists of 
metasediments traditionally divided into the Roan and  Lower and Upper Kundelungu Supergroups 
(Cailteux et al., 1994; Francois, 1995). Distribution of the Nchanga Granite in the Zambian 
Copperbelt relative to Katangan sequences is illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
More recently, Wendorff (2001, 2003) and Master et al. (2005) have proposed a new 
lithostratigraphic scheme in which the Katanga Supergroup is subdivided into the Roan, Nguba and 
Kundelungu Groups, with two additional lithotectonic units, the Fungurume and Plateau Groups, 
which were deposited syntectonically in a foreland basin during deformation of the earlier 
Katangan groups during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. 
 
Rocks of the Katanga Supergroup were deformed and metamorphosed during the Lufilian (c. 600-
512 Ma) Orogeny (Cosi et al., 1992; Porada and Berhorst, 2000; Rainaud et al., 2002, 2005; John et 
al., 2003, 2004), while supposedly correlative lithologies in the Zambezi Belt were also deformed 
and metamorphosed during the Lusakan (c. 840 Ma) Orogeny (Hanson et al., 1994). The 
depositional age and duration of the Roan Group has been very poorly constrained, with the 
available data suggesting a range between c. 1200 and 870 Ma (Cahen et al., 1984). Kampunzu and 
Cailteux (1999) suggested a maximum age of 980 Ma for the Katanga Supergroup, based on the 
presence in basal Katangan conglomerates of pebbles of c. 980 Ma Kibaran tin granites (Madi, 
1985), as well as of detrital cassiterite in lowermost Roan sediments (Jedwab, 1997). The minimum 
age of the entire Katanga Supergroup was established by Cahen (1973) at 620 Ma, based on U-Pb 
dating of post-Kundelungu uraninite veins. However, more recent dating of detrital muscovites 
from the Kundelungu Plateau give a maximum age of 573 ± 5 Ma for the uppermost Katangan 
sediments of the Plateau Group, which were deposited in a foreland basin during the Lufilian 
Orogeny (Master et al., 2005).

ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES 
 
In this study a population of zircons was obtained from the Nchanga Granite (pink variety), which 
was sampled in borehole P322, drilled in the underground section of Nchanga Mine, where it is 
nonconformably overlain by coarse clastic sediments of the lower Roan Group (Table 1). Suites of 
detrital zircons were extracted from crossbedded Roan arkoses and sandstones sampled at 6 and 23 
metres above the contact with the Nchanga Granite in the same borehole (P322) drilled at Nchanga 
Mine from which the granite sample was obtained (Table 1). The separation of zircons was 
performed at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, using 
conventional techniques. The separated zircons were examined and characterised using 
cathodoluminescence imagery. All zircons were analysed randomly. U-Pb analyses were performed 
on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion Microprobe (SHRIMP II) at the Research School of Earth 
Sciences, Australian National University. The SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is 
similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). Age calculations and plotting were carried 
out using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) and all ages are quoted with errors at the 1σ level. The zircons 
show typically magmatic features such as oscillatory zoning and euhedral outlines, with no cores.

NCHANGA GRANITE 
 
The youngest intrusion in the pre-Katangan basement is the Nchanga Granite, which is an 
unfoliated, coarse-grained, peraluminous biotitic alkali granite with A-type geochemical 
characteristics (Cahen et al., 1970b; Tembo et al., 2000). The Nchanga Granite has red and grey 
varieties (O’Meara, 1959; in McKinnon and Smit, 1961), and is cut by thin aplite dykes, which are 
regarded as the final phase of a composite intrusion. A maximum age limit on the Katanga 
Supergroup would be the age of the Nchanga Granite, which has provided detritus in the form of 
granitic pebbles and zircons in the overlying Roan sediments (Binda, 1972; Garlick, 1973; 
Fleischer et al., 1976). 
 
Many previous attempts at dating the Nchanga Granite have yielded unsatisfactory results. An age 
of 490 ± 20 Ma based on K-Ar dating of biotite probably reflects resetting during the Lufilian 
Orogeny (Snelling et al., 1964). Whole rock Rb-Sr dating gave an age of 604 ± 40 Ma, while Rb-Sr 
dating of whole rock powders and mineral separates from the Nchanga Granite gave isochron ages 
of c. 500 to 455 Ma, again reflecting a younger resetting event, possibly during the waning stages 
of the Lufilian Orogeny (Snelling et al., 1964; Drysdall and Garrard, 1964; Armstrong et al., 1999). 
The first attempt at U-Pb dating of zircons from the Nchanga Granite was made by Cahen et al. 
(1970b), who obtained two discordant multi-grain zircon fractions with very different 207Pb/206Pb 
ages of 710 Ma and 551 Ma. Using the assumption that these zircons contained common lead with 
the isotopic composition of Copperbelt galena leads, Cahen et al. (1970b) obtained a model age of 
c. 600 Ma for the Nchanga Granite. Further interpretations of the discordant zircons ages of Cahen 
et al. (1970b), led Cahen (1975) to propose a possible upper intercept concordia age of 960 Ma 
(recalculated by Cahen et al., 1984, as 954 Ma). Cahen et al. (1984) quoted unpublished data from 
Binda, which indicated an imprecise Pb-Pb age of 1100–1200 Ma for the Nchanga Granite. 
Palaeomagnetic results from the grey and pink varieties of the Nchanga Granite were interpreted 
geochronologically by comparison with the Neoproterozoic polar wander path for southern Africa 
(Thomson and Sweeney, 1995). The Nchanga Grey Granite gave an age of 1200-1100 Ma, while 
the Nchanga Pink Granite gave an age of between 700 and 600 Ma (Thomson and Sweeney, 1995). 
However, palaeomagnetic results similar to those from both varieties of Nchanga Granite were also 
obtained from the overlying Roan Group sediments (Thomson and Sweeney, 1995), hence the age 
interpretations cannot be correct, and the palaeomagnetic poles represent some kind of magnetic 
overprint whose significance is unclear.

A hand-picked suite of 13 magmatic zircons (free of fractures and inclusions) was analysed and the 
results are listed in Table 2 and plotted on a concordia diagram in Figure 2. The analyses plot in a 
single cluster and no xenocrysts were detected in the present sample set. The weighted mean 
207Pb/206Pb age of all analysed zircons yields an age of 883 ± 10 Ma with MSWD = 0.12. This is 
interpreted as the emplacement age of this phase of the Nchanga Granite.

KATANGA SUPERGROUP- LOWER ROAN GROUP SEDIMENTS 
 
Conglomeratic and arkosic sediments of the siliciclastic unit in the lower Roan Group at Nchanga 
Mine nonconformably overlie the Nchanga Granite, a relationship that is well exposed in the 
Nchanga open pit (Fig. 3). Previous studies have indicated that there are pebbles and zircons from 
the Nchanga Granite in basal Roan conglomerates, suggesting that the lower Roan sediments are 
derived by erosion of a proximal basement that included the Nchanga Granite (Binda, 1972; 
Garlick, 1973). Despite the overwhelming field evidence for an unconformable contact between the 
Nchanga Granite and the Roan sediments, there have been attempts to argue that the granite was 
intrusive into Roan sediments. Such attempts (e.g., by Gysin, 1960), were based on the intersection 
of supposed dykes of granite within the Roan sediments. However, it was shown by Garlick (1973) 
and by Fleischer et al. (1976) that these supposed dykes were exfoliated slabs of granite near the 
unconformity surface, or large boulders of granite intersected in drill core, and mistaken for dykes.

conglomerate containing large boulders of Nchanga Granite (above the hammer head and dashed 
line), overlain by coarse-grained arkose. Exposure in the Nchanga open pit.  
 
 
U-Pb SHRIMP dating of these lower Roan Group detrital zircons, from both the arkose and the 
feldspathic sandstone (samples 2 and 1 respectively), using the same procedures as those applicable 
to the Nchanga Granite, reveals two distinct age populations (Table 3 and Fig. 4a,b), one at 
between 2000 to 1800 Ma (corresponding to the range of ages in the adjacent Palaeoproterozoic 

--- Page 10 ---

Lufubu Metamorphic Complex basement; Rainaud et al., 2005), and the other at around 880 Ma 
(corresponding to the age of the Nchanga Granite presented above). This demonstrates that the 
Nchanga Granite provided detritus to the Lower Roan, and had been unroofed by the time 
deposition in the Katangan basin commenced. It sets an unequivocal lower limit of 880 Ma for the 
age of the Katanga Supergroup. The poorly sorted, coarse clastic, lower Roan sediments were 
derived from a proximal provenance that comprised both the 880 Ma Nchanga Granite as well as 
the Palaeoproterozoic Lufubu basement. 
 
INTRUSIVE DYKES IN LOWER ROAN GROUP SEDIMENTS 
 
At least three intrusive rocks cut lower Roan Group sediments exposed in the Nchanga open pit. 
Felsic dykes cut meta-arkoses in borehole NOP-589 and also intrude schistose siliciclastic 
metasediments in borehole NOP-681. These dykes contain zircons, but SHRIMP U-Pb analysis 
indicates that all are xenocrystic and derived from the local basement. Additional analyses of rutile 
and sphene from these dykes are the object of a current study that will further constrain the 
minimum ages of both the Roan Group as well as the stratiform Cu-Co mineralization within it 
(Robb et al., in prep.).  
 
DISCUSSION 
 
The 883 ± 10 Ma age of the Nchanga Granite sets a considerably younger new maximum age for 
the Katanga Supergroup. This age is indistinguishable from the 879 ± 16 Ma age of the Kafue 
Rhyolite, which is at the base of supposed Katangan-equivalent supracrustals of the Zambezi Belt 
(Hanson et al., 1994). This event suggests that felsic magmatism occurred just prior to, or during, 
the early rifting stages of Katangan basin formation (Armstrong et al., 1999). This view would best 
be compatible with a scenario in which the Katangan rifts were limited in extent and formed in 
response to the rifting of a composite terrane consisting of both the Kalahari and Congo Cratons 
(e.g., Master, 1990, 1993; Hanson, 2003). Recently published data on MORB-type eclogites in the 
Zambezi Belt (John et al., 2003), however, give an age of c. 590 Ma for eclogite formation at high 
pressures (up to 23 kb), and suggest the presence of a wide ocean basin (>1000 km), which closed 
by subduction of oceanic crust to depths of >90 km, prior to exhumation. Furthermore, high-
pressure talc-kyanite white schists from the Lufilian Arc and the Zambezi Belt record metamorphic 
ages on monazite of c. 530 Ma (John et al., 2004). The Zambezi Belt could, therefore, be 
interpreted as a collisional suture between two widely separated cratons (the Congo and Kalahari), 
so that rocks such as the Nchanga Granite on the Congo Craton cannot be genetically related to 
similar aged units in the Zambezi Belt, which were on the northern edge of the Kalahari Craton. 
Furthermore, the interpretation of the Zambezi Belt supracrustals, which include the Makuti Group 
of NW Zimbabwe, as a bimodal rift sequence (Munyanyiwa et al., 1997), has been questioned by 
Dirks et al. (1999) who showed that rocks described as “meta-arkoses” (Broderick, 1976) and 
“meta-rhyolites” (Munyanyiwa et al., 1997) are, in fact, sheared granites.  The age of the Nchanga 
Granite is similar to, but slightly older than, those of the Lusaka Granite (842 ± 33 Ma; recalculated 
from Barr et al., 1978), the Ngoma Gneiss in the Zambezi Belt (820 ± 7 Ma; Hanson et al., 1988), 
and a megacrystic granite dated at 852 ± 11 Ma in the Tsumkwe area near the southern edge of the 
Congo Craton (Hoal et al., 2000). Our preferred interpretation, therefore, is that the granitoids and 
felsic volcanics of the Zambezi Belt in SW Zambia were probably on an entirely different crustal 
fragment or continent at this time and should not be correlated with the Nchanga Granite. The latter 
remains the only known granitic intrusion of Neoproterozoic age in the Copperbelt region. 
 
The felsic dykes at Nchanga contain xenocrystic zircons sourced from the Proterozoic basement of 
the Central African Copperbelt (Rainaud et al., 2005). These dykes cut across Roan Group 
sediments and probably represent the feeders to sills (Tembo et al., 1999) and extrusive lavas 
higher  in the Katangan  succession, such  as the  760 ± 5 Ma  Lwavu  volcanics in western  Zambia

(Key et al., 2001). These volcanics are located within the Mwashya Subgroup, which 
stratigraphically overlies the Roan Group. Additional evidence for magmatic activity at this period 
is present in the form of the gabbroic intrusions within Katangan carbonate sediments of the 
Solwezi area, NW Zambia, which have yielded ages of 745 ± 7.8 Ma and 752.6 ± 8.6 Ma (Barron 
et al., 2003). These ages collectively constrain deposition of the Roan and Mwashya sediments to 
the interval between 880 and 760 Ma. Cahen et al. (1970a, 1984) reported the ages of two 
metamorphic microcline veins cutting the Roan Group at Luanshya and Musoshi, as being 840 ± 42 
Ma, hence setting a younger limit to the age of the Roan Group. However, we regard these Rb/Sr 
model ages to be unreliable, hence 880 Ma remains the most reliable maximum age of the Katanga 
Supergroup. This new maximum age precludes a suggested correlation of the Katangan with the 
older (948 ± 15 Ma) Bushimay or Mbuji Mayi Supergroup in the Congo (Cahen et al., 1984), but 
reinforces the likelihood of correlations with similar sequences within the Damaran and West 
Congolian orogenic belts (Miller, 1983; Tack et al., 2001). 
 
Whereas previously they were thought to reflect diachronous basin development spanning several 
hundred million years (Porada, 1989), the Katanga and Damara Supergroups are now regarded as 
part of a single episode of rifting and passive margin formation, followed by later subduction and 
continental collision, on the southern margin of the greater Congo Craton (Master, 2004; Rainaud 
et al., 2005). The mafic lavas and gabbroic intrusions in the Mwashya Subgroup, which range in 
age between 760 ± 5 Ma and 745 ± 7.8 Ma, have the same range of ages as felsic volcanics and 
intrusive syenites from the Damara Supergroup, in the Summas Mountains of northern Namibia 
(Hoffman et al., 1996). In the Summas Mountains, the basal Damaran rocks consist of a continental 
succession of feldspathic sandstones and conglomerates of the Nosib Group, which record 
continental rifting in the southern margin of the Congo Craton (Hoffmann, 1994). The Nosib Group 
is  overlain here by the Ugab Subgroup, a mixed association of syn- to post-extensional carbonates 
and terrigenous sedimentary rocks (Miller, 1980). In  the Damara Supergroup, a felsic ash-flow tuff

from the Naauwpoort Formation of the upper Nosib Group and a rhyolite from the lower Ugab 
Subgroup have yielded indistinguishable U-Pb zircon ages of 746 ± 2 and 747 ± 2 Ma, respectively 
(Hoffman et al., 1996). The Oas quartz syenite, which intrudes the lower Nosib Group, has been 
dated at 756 ± 2 Ma (Hoffman et al., 1996) and, hence, the lowermost Nosib Group, at the base of 
the Damara Supergroup, is older than this. Because the pre-Damaran basement in the southern 
Congo Craton is of Palaeoproterozoic (c. 2000 to 1800 Ma) age (Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985), the 
age of the lowermost Damaran sediments is not well constrained. The age equivalence of intrusive 
and extrusive rocks in the Mwashya Subgroup, and of the intrusive and extrusive Damaran rocks of 
the Summas Mountains suggests a correlation between the Mwashya Subgroup and the 
Naauwpoort Group and lower Ugab Subgroups. This also suggests a correlation between the pre-
Mwashya Roan Group, and the lowermost Nosib Group. The maximum age of 880 Ma for the

Roan Group obtained in this paper may also, therefore, represent a maximum age for the Nosib 
Group at the base of the Damara Supergroup.
