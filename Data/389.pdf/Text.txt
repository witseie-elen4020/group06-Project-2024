GEOCHRONOLOGY AND NATURE OF THE PALAEOPROTEROZOIC 
BASEMENT IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT (ZAMBIA AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO), WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age data, together with geochemical analyses, from the basement to the 
Katanga Supergroup in the Central African Copperbelt reveal the existence of a widespread 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane. The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc-
alkaline volcanic arc sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic 
of Congo (DRC), yield ages of 1980 ± 7, 1968 ± 9, 1964 ± 12 and 1874 ± 8 Ma. The oldest 
dated unit from the region, the Mkushi granitic gneiss from southeast of the Zambian 
Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 ± 6 Ma. The copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut 
the foliation in the Mkushi Gneisses, have mainly xenocrystic, zoned zircons with cores dated 
at c. 2070–2000 Ma. Overgrowths on these cores are dated at 1059 ± 26 Ma, which is 
interpreted as the intrusive age of the aplites. An augen gneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge 
locality yielded an emplacement age of 1976 ± 5 Ma. The Mufulira Pink Granite has an age of 
1994 ± 7 Ma, while the Chambishi Granite has been dated at 1983 ± 5 Ma, an age within error 
of Lufubu schist metavolcanics from elsewhere in the Chambishi basin. The gneisses, 
granitoids and acid-intermediate, calc-alkaline metavolcanics are considered to represent 
stages in the evolution of one or more magmatic arcs that formed episodically over a 200 
million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. We suggest naming this assemblage of rocks 
the “Lufubu Metamorphic Complex”. The rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex are 
interpreted to be part of a regionally extensive Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane 
stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and the DRC. This terrane is termed the 
Kamanjab-Bangweulu arc and is inferred to have collided with the Archaean Tanzanian 
Craton during the c. 2000–1900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new composite 
minicontinental entity that we term the “Kambantan” terrane. The Kambantan terrane was 
accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the c. 1400–1000 Ma Kibaran 
Orogeny.

GEOCHRONOLOGY AND NATURE OF THE PALAEOPROTEROZOIC BASEMENT IN 
THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT (ZAMBIA AND THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO), WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Central African Copperbelt is a world-class stratabound Cu-Co metallogenic province, hosted 
by Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup. It extends from the Zambian 
Copperbelt to the Congolese Copperbelt in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) (Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961a). Much of the age data relating to the Central 
African Copperbelt was produced in the period 1960-1980 using Rb-Sr and K-Ar techniques 
(Cahen et al., 1984). The existing data are generally imprecise and their interpretation 
controversial. In the mid-1990s a project was undertaken using the ion-microprobe U-Pb single 
zircon technique to provide more accurate time constraints on the Central African Copperbelt. In 
this study we present new data related to the basement of the Katangan and discuss their 
significance in terms of the evolution of the Central African Copperbelt. An accompanying paper 
(Master et al., 2005) presents additional constraints on the provenance ages of the Katanga 
Supergroup, while the ages of metamorphic events that have affected the Katangan metasediments 
are presented in Rainaud et al. (2005). 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND PREVIOUS GEOCHRONOLOGY 
 
The Katanga Supergroup was deformed during the Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic eras into an 
arcuate fold-thrust belt known as the Lufilian Arc. It unconformably overlies a fertile basement 
which has long been recognised as also containing widespread copper mineralization (Pienaar, 
1961; Wakefield, 1978). To the west, the Lufilian Arc is flanked by the c. 1400-1000 Ma Kibaran 
Belt, which separates it from the Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Kasai-Angola 
Block, which forms part of the larger Congo Craton (Cahen et al. 1984; Delhal, 1991; Tack et al., 
1999). To the southeast, the Lufilian Arc is flanked by the Mesoproterozoic Irumide Belt (Daly et 
al., 1984).  
 
Although the Central African Copperbelt extends through both the Democratic Republic of Congo 
and Zambia and has a strike length of 700 km in the Lufilian Arc (Figs. 1, 2), the pre-Katangan 
basement is mainly exposed in Zambia and immediately adjacent areas of the Democratic Republic 
of Congo (Brock, 1961; Demesmaeker et al., 1963). This fact, and other lithological and structural 
factors, led François (1974) to distinguish two provinces in the Central African Copperbelt: (1) the 
Zambian Province, extending from Zambia to the Congolese deposits close to the border (such as 
Musoshi and Kinsenda); and (2) the Congolese Province, extending from Lubumbashi to Kolwezi. 
Anticline (Garlick, 1961a). In adjacent areas of Katanga, basement exposures are found in the 
Konkola, Luina and Mokambo Domes (Gysin, 1933; Lecompte, 1933). About half of the pre-
Katangan basement consists of the Lufubu schists, and the rest consists mainly of a variety of 
supposedly intrusive granitoids (Gray, 1929; Mendelsohn, 1961b, c). Some of these granitoids were 
previously regarded as also being intrusive into the Katangan sequence, but this was disproven by 
Garlick  and Brummer (1951), who  showed that all  granites in the Copperbelt are of pre-Katangan  
age, and are unconformably overlain by Katangan rocks. Post-Katangan intrusive granitoids form 
several plutons in the western and southern exposed parts of the Lufilian Arc in Zambia (Thieme 
and  Johnson, 1981) and  in the Hook massif and  adjacent areas of the inner part of the Lufilian 
Arc. In the Zambian Province, the basement rocks are exposed in a structural high known as the 
Kafue (Hanson et al., 1993). The granitoids  intrusive  into  the Lufubu schists were first dated by     
Cahen et al. (1968,  1970 b,  c) using  bulk zircon  U-Pb  dating,  and  were  shown  to  represent  a

Palaeoproterozoic magmatic suite with imprecise ages spanning 2018–1702 Ma (Cahen et al., 
1984). Cahen et al. (1970c) dated the Grey Granodiorite at Mufulira using two near-concordant 
bulk zircon fractions. Depending on whether Pb-loss was assumed to be at zero age (model 1), or 
whether it occurred during the Kibaran Orogeny at c. 1300 Ma (model 2), they obtained model ages 
of 1945 Ma (model 1) to 2018 Ma (model 2) for the Mufulira Grey Granodiorite (Cahen et al., 
1984). The Roan Antelope Granite at Luanshya yielded a (recalculated) 207Pb/206Pb isochron age, 
based on four bulk zircon fractions, of 1702 Ma (Cahen et al., 1970c; 1984). Cliff and Clemmey 
(1976) obtained a Rb-Sr model age of c. 2000 Ma on muscovite from a pegmatite cutting basement 
rocks at Mindola Mine. A granitoid from the Luina Dome in the DRC, close to the Zambian 
Copperbelt, has been dated at 1882 +23/-19 Ma (Ngoyi et al., 1991). The Lufubu schists were 
constrained to be older than 2049 ± 103 Ma to 2198 ± 108, based on a model Rb-Sr age of a post-
Lufubu, pre-Katangan pegmatite, with assumed initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the range 0.705 to 0.710 
(Cahen et al., 1970a, 1984).  
 
The Palaeoproterozoic basement rocks of the Copperbelt extend northwards to the Luapula 
Province of Zambia and the Marungu Plateau of the DRC, southwest of Lake Tanganyika, where 
they constitute the basement of the Bangweulu Block (Drysdall et al., 1972; Brewer et al., 1979; 
Kabengele et al., 1990; Andersen and Unrug, 1984). Brewer et al. (1979) obtained Rb-Sr isochron 
ages of 1816 ± 22 Ma and 1833 ± 18 Ma, for a rhyolite and a granitoid from the western part of the 
Bangweulu Block. These rocks have relatively low initial 86Sr/86Sr ratios (Ri) of 0.70328 and 
0.70327,  respectively,  indicating  a  similar source  in  the  juvenile  crust  or  upper  mantle. In the

Marungu Plateau, three intrusive complexes have yielded whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron ages of 1863 
± 53 Ma, 1861 ± 28 Ma and 1695 ± 43 Ma, with Ri = 0.70277, 0.7026 and 0.70436 respectively 
(Kabengele et al., 1990). In northeast Zambia, granitoids of the Bangweulu Block have yielded 
whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron ages of 1869 ± 20 Ma, 1838 ± 43 Ma and 1824 ± 75 Ma 
(Schandelmeier, 1981, 1983).  
 
To the southeast of the Copperbelt, the Irumide Belt of northeast Zambia consists of quartzites and 
metapelites of the Manshya River Group, together with syntectonic to late-tectonic granitoid 
plutons, amphibolite-facies gneisses, and migmatites (Daly, 1986; Tembo et al., 2002; De Waele 
and Mapani, 2002). A metarhyolite interbedded with metasediments from the northern part of the 
belt in the Chinsali area has yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1880 ± 12 Ma, which gives the 
depositional age for the Manshya River Group (De Waele and Mapani, 2002). Syn- to late-tectonic 
intrusive granitoids in the Irumide Belt are dated at between 1046 ± 77 Ma and 953 ± 19 Ma, with a 
metamorphic peak at c. 1020 Ma (De Waele et al., 2003; SHRIMP U-Pb single zircon dates). 
Monazite growth at ultrahigh-temperature peak metamorphic conditions (T = 875°– 900°C; P ~ 6 
kb) took place at 1046 ± 3 Ma in garnet-cordierite gneisses in the eastern Irumide Belt near Chipata 
(Schenk and Appel, 2001, 2002). The basement to the Irumide Belt consists partly of granitoid 
gneisses referred to as the Mkushi Gneisses. These are intruded by the Mtuga granites and 
associated aplites (which are mineralized with Cu at the Mkushi Mine; Legg, 1976). The Mkushi 
Gneisses yielded a whole-rock Rb-Sr date of 1777 ± 89 Ma, while the Mtuga Granite yielded a date 
of 607 ± 39 Ma (N’gambi et al., 1986). A model Rb-Sr age of 1693 ± 50 Ma (assuming Ri = 0.709) 
was obtained for an aplite from Mkushi (Cahen and Snelling, 1966; recalculated by Cahen et al., 
1984).  Recent SHRIMP zircon dating by De Waele et al. (2003) of the Lukamfwa Hill granitic 
gneisses, between Mkushi and Serenje in the western part of the central Irumide Belt, yielded ages

between 1664 ± 9 Ma and 1639 ± 14 Ma. Other gneissic granites from the northern Irumide Belt 
have yielded zircon ages of 1592 ± 43 Ma and 1519 ± 19 Ma (De Waele et al., 2003).  
 
In the Copperbelt region, the Lufubu schists and the intrusive granitoids are unconformably 
overlain by quartzites and schists of the Muva Supergroup (Garlick, 1961b). The Muva 
metasediments have a maximum age of 1941 ± 40 Ma, which is the age of the youngest detrital 
zircon dated by Rainaud et al. (2003) from these sediments. The youngest pre-Katangan intrusive 
in the basement is the Nchanga Granite, with a SHRIMP zircon age of 877 ± 10 Ma, which gives 
the maximum age for Katangan sedimentation (Armstrong et al., 1999, 2005).  
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
Major element analyses were performed using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry on a Philips 
spectrometer, in the Department of Geology, School of Geosciences, University of the 
Witwatersrand.  Major elements were determined using the fusion technique of Norrish and Hutton 
(1969). Trace element analyses were done on pressed powder pellets by XRF using the method of 
Feather and Willis (1976). 
 
The separation of zircons was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, Johannesburg, using 
conventional techniques. The separated zircons were examined and characterised in term of 
uranium contents using the cathodoluminescence technique. All zircons were randomly selected for 
analysis, but the locations of the analysed spots were chosen to avoid areas of anomalously high or 
low uranium contents. U-Pb analyses were performed on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion 
Microprobe (SHRIMP) I and II at the Australian National University, Canberra. The SHRIMP 
analytical procedure used in this study is similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). 
Age calculations and plotting of analytical data were carried out using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) 
and all ages are quoted with errors at the 1σ level.  
 
RESULTS 
 
A total of eleven samples were dated for the purposes of this study, representing Lufubu schist 
metavolcanics (4 samples), and granitoids and granitoid gneisses (7 samples) from the basement to 
the Katanga Supergroup of the Central African Copperbelt and from an adjacent area in the Irumide 
Belt. Nine of these samples were collected in Zambia and two in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (Figs. 1, 2). 
 
Lufubu schists 
 
Gray (1929) first differentiated highly deformed Lufubu schists and gneisses from overlying Muva 
metasedimentary rocks. Jackson (1932) called the Lufubu schists of the Nchanga area the 
“Basement Schist Series”, consisting of garnetiferous chlorite schists, quartz-mica schists and 
biotite gneisses, which he regarded as being metasedimentary in origin and Archaean in age. 
Mendelsohn (1961b) described the Lufubu schists as mica schists, quartzites and gneisses with 
minor metamorphosed carbonates, conglomerates, subgreywackes and arkoses, extensively 
intruded by granites. He regarded the majority of the Lufubu schists as metasediments with the 
possibility of some minor metavolcanics. Unconformably overlying the Lufubu schists are the 
Muva metasediments, which consist of deformed quartzites, metaconglomerates and metapelitic 
schists (Garlick, 1961b).

Geochemistry of the Lufubu schists 
 
Whole-rock geochemistry was undertaken on Lufubu schists from the Mwambashi B prospect in 
the Chambishi basin, Baluba Mine near Luanshya, the Kafue River south of Mufulira (Fig. 3) and 
from Kinsenda in the DRC. Samples were analysed for both major and trace elements (Table 1), 
and were examined petrographically for their mineralogical and textural characteristics. All 
samples present porphyritic textures with fine-grained matrices of metamorphic sericite. Lufubu 
schist compositions are presented in a Zr/TiO2 vs Nb/Y diagram (Winchester and Floyd, 1977) (Fig. 
4) which shows that these rocks plot in the andesite/ rhyodacite-dacite/ trachyandesite/ alkali basalt 
domain. The sample suite has characteristics consistent with a metavolcanic origin. The same 
analyses together with those from the host rocks of the Samba porphyry (Wakefield, 1978) are 
plotted in the AFM geochemical discrimination diagram of Irvine and Baragar (1971) (Fig. 5). All 
analyses show enrichments in the alkalis Na2O+K2O compared to FeO, and they plot in the calc-
alkaline field. Because these rocks may have suffered mobility of major elements during 
metamorphism, the AFM plot can only be used to suggest that the data are consistent with the 
Lufubu schists being mainly calc-alkaline metavolcanic rocks. The Lufubu schist metavolcanic 
rocks, together with subordinate metasedimentary rocks such as quartzites and marbles, are 
regarded as having formed in a subduction-related magmatic arc.  
 
Mufulira Lufubu schist (sample LufMuf) 
 
Sample LufMuf was collected from the Mufulira Mine, on the eastern flank of the Kafue anticline 
(Fig. 2). It is a blastoporphyritic metavolcanic derived from a hornblende-quartz porphyry in which 
the fine-grained matrix and amphibole-phenocrysts are replaced by intergrowths of epidote, biotite, 
chlorite, quartz magnetite and sphene (Fig. 6). Fourteen analyses were undertaken on 14 zircons 
from this sample. Cathodoluminescence images and plane-polarised photomicrographs (Fig. 7) 
show three types of zircons; euhedral, broken and abraded. All zircons exhibit an oscillatory zoning 
consistent with an igneous origin. The c-axes of the zircons are up to 200 µm in length. Euhedral 
zircons represent more than 50% of the entire population. Results of the analyses are reported in 
Table 2 and plotted on a concordia diagram in Figure 8. Two distinct populations and one older 
single zircon (zircon no. 8 on the CL image and in Table 2) are evident. The oldest zircon yields a 
207Pb/206Pb age of 2174 ± 13 Ma. The older of the two main populations includes three zircons 
(zircons no. 1, 5 and 11), all broken pieces, which yield a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057 ± 
9 Ma (MSWD = 1.8). It is unclear whether these zircons were broken during their incorporation as 
xenocrysts, or if they were broken during sample preparation. The youngest population consists of 
ten zircons (zircons no. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 on the CL image and in Table 2) and 
yielded an average mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma with a MSWD = 1.6. On the CL 
image, these ten zircons are euhedral. An attempt at differentiating the three populations of zircons 
by plotting age versus Th/U ratio was made (Fig. 9). Th/U results from the youngest population 
(mean age at 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma) are scattered and vary between 0.36 and 2.18. The group of three 
broken zircons plots between 0.63 and 0.88. The oldest single zircon has the lowest Th/U ratio of 
0.34. Thus, there appears to be an inverse exponential trend between age and Th/U ratios; however, 
no definitive interpretation can be made, as the data set is not large enough. The age of the 
youngest population (1968 ± 9 Ma) is interpreted as the age of the protolith of the Lufubu 
metavolcanics at Mufulira. This interpretation is consistent with the igneous characteristics of the 
dated grains. The four older zircons are regarded as inherited. 
 
Kinsenda meta-trachyandesite (sample KNS1) 
 
Sample KNS1 was collected at Kinsenda Mine (DRC) on the southern flank of the Luina Dome 
near the border with Zambia (Figs. 2 and 10). It is a metatrachyandesitic porphyry with relic alkali-

feldspar phenocrysts showing perthitic texture (Fig. 11). Feldspar phenocrysts are quite deformed 
(some are kinked) and the matrix of biotite and muscovite shows two generations of metamorphic 
muscovite. Cathodoluminescence imaging shows that the zircons are large (Fig. 12), with the long 
axis ≥ 200 µm. All zircons exhibit an oscillatory zoning consistent with an igneous origin. Sixteen 
analyses were undertaken on 15 zircons (Table 3, Fig. 13). All analyses are concordant or less than 
15% discordant and plot in a single cluster. All the analyses yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb 
age of 1873.5 ± 8.3 Ma (MSWD = 1.7). This age is interpreted as the igneous age of the 
trachyandesitic protolith of the Lufubu schist at Kinsenda.

Chambishi meta-trachyandesite (sample BN53/1) 
 
Borehole BN53 is located in a prospect area called Mwambashi B, on the western flank of the 
Chambishi Basin (Fig. 2). The total depth of this drill hole is 693.43 m, and the sample was 
collected from a depth of 685.35 m, ~20 m below the contact with basal Katangan sediments. 
BN53/1 is interpreted as a trachyandesitic metavolcanic quartz porphyry with relict deformed 
quartz and plagioclase phenocrysts (Table 1), which was transformed into a blastoporphyritic 
biotite-sericite schist (Fig. 14). Ten zircons from BN53/1 were analysed (Table 4, Fig. 15). The 
analyses plot in a single cluster and their weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age is 1980 ± 7 Ma (MSWD = 
0.55). This result is interpreted as the igneous age of the protolith volcanic rock.

Samba felsic metavolcanic schist (sample CT169/1256) 
 
The Samba prospect is the largest copper deposit located in the basement of the Central African 
Copperbelt and consists of disseminations, stringers and veinlets of copper sulphides in quartz-
sericite schists derived from porphyritic igneous rocks of quartz monzonite to granodioritic 
composition (Wakefield, 1978). Ore resources have been estimated at fifty million tons with an 
overall grade of about 0.5% Cu (Wakefield, 1978). The Samba prospect has been described by 
Wakefield (1978) as a porphyry-type deposit because of the presence of alteration zones, including 
a central sericitic core, as well as crackle-brecciation textures and the presence of chalcopyrite plus 
pyrite vein and disseminated mineralization (Fig. 16). The analysed sample is an epidotised biotite-
muscovite-K-feldspar-quartz 
schist, 
interpreted 
as 
a 
felsic 
metavolcanic 
rock. 
A 
cathodoluminescence image (Fig. 17) shows zircons with long axes < 200 µm. A striking feature of 

--- Page 20 ---
 
16
these zircons is the presence of irregular, low-uranium overgrowths. These overgrowths could not, 
however, be dated with the SHRIMP as they are smaller than the beam diameter. They could well 
be hydrothermal or metamorphic in origin, but their origin is still enigmatic. They resemble 
overgrowths of xenotime on zircons found in other samples from the Zambian Copperbelt (M. 
Hitzman, pers. comm., 2003). Although a few of the zircons appear to be subrounded, the CL 
imagery shows that some of them are in fact euhedral zircons with the younger overgrowths. 
Sixteen analyses were performed on 16 zircons (Table 5, Fig. 18). All but three analyses plot in a 
cluster which yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1964 ± 12 Ma (MSWD = 1.8). This result 
is interpreted as the emplacement age of the metavolcanic rock. Analyses 12.1, 13.1 and 16.1 gave 
older 207Pb/206Pb ages (2160 ± 25 Ma, 2336 ± 9 Ma and 2423 ± 13 Ma respectively). These three 
zircons are interpreted as xenocrystic.

Granitoids and granitoid gneisses 
 
Mkushi Gneiss (sample MGn) 
 
First described by Bancroft and Pelletier (1929), Truter (1935) and Ackerman (1935, 1936), the 
banded to porphyroblastic biotitic granitoid Mkushi Gneiss was originally considered to be part of 
the Mkushi Group, comprising the Mkushi gneiss complex and some granites (Stillman,1965). De 
Waele and Mapani (2002) redefined the Mkushi Group as the “Mkushi Basement Complex” 
(MBC), which forms part of the basement to the southern Irumide Belt in central Zambia and 
includes granitoid gneisses and granites. Jackson (1932) first correlated granitic gneisses of the 
Nchanga area on the Copperbelt with the Mkushi Gneisses from the Mkushi area, as defined by 
Bancroft and Pelletier (1929).  
 
Field relations of the Mkushi Gneiss are complex and record several episodes of intrusion. The 
oldest intrusion is the biotite-bearing granite Mkushi Gneiss itself, which is strongly deformed and 
partly migmatitic. A second intrusive episode is represented by weakly deformed amphibolitic 
mafic dykes which cut across the foliation of the Mkushi Gneiss. Later undeformed aplite dykes, 
grading in places into pegmatites, are related to the Mtuga Granite and cut both the Mkushi Gneiss 
and the mafic dykes (Stillman, 1965; N’gambi et al., 1986). The Mtuga aplites are mineralised and 
contain chalcopyrite and pyrite associated with rutile and sphene, with minor local bornite and 
traces of molybdenite (Omenetto, 1973, 1974; Legg, 1976). It is these bodies that have been 
exploited at the Mkushi copper mines, in the Munshiwemba open pit and the Mtuga underground 
operation, both of which ceased operations in the 1970’s (Legg, 1976). Sample MGn comes from 
the typical Mkushi Gneiss exposed in the Munshiwemba open pit of the Mkushi copper mines (Fig. 
1 and 19). Twelve zircons were analysed (Table 6, Fig. 20). The analyses plot in a single cluster 
and yield a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2048.8 ± 5.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.85); excluding analysis 
2.1 which is the most reversely discordant. This result is interpreted as the age of emplacement for 
the protolith of the Mkushi Gneiss.

Mtuga Aplites (samples APL-1 and APL-2) 
 
Zircons from two mineralised Mtuga Aplites (Fig. 21) cutting the Mkushi Gneiss were analysed. 
These aplites occur as pink- and cream-coloured intrusions and are post-tectonic relative to the 
deformation and metamorphism that affected the host gneisses. Fourteen zircons from sample APL-
1 were analysed (Table 7, Fig. 22). Most of the zircons observed were distinctly zoned, comprising 
cores and thin rims that were too small to analyse. Ages for APL-1 were only obtained from cores, 
which show a range in 206Pb/207Pb ages from 2072 ± 9 Ma to 2009 ± 4 Ma. These cores are 
interpreted as xenocrystic. Nineteen cores and twelve rims of zircons from sample APL-2 were also  
analysed (Table 8, Fig. 23).  High–uranium zircon rims yielded a significantly younger 207Pb/206Pb 
age of 1059 ± 26 Ma (mean of 10 analyses) shown as an upper intercept in Figure 22. This age is 
interpreted  as  the  age  of intrusion  of  the  aplites.  They  are related  to the emplacement of other

Mufulira Pink Granite (sample MPG) 
 
Two distinct phases of granitoids are present in the vicinity of the Mufulira Mine (Brandt et al., 
1961). The western Mufulira Grey Granodiorite, which is the most abundant, is uniformly grey and 
is characterised by xenoliths of Lufubu schist (Brandt et al., 1961; Cahen et al., 1970c). This is a 
typical biotite granodiorite (also called a tonalite by Darnley, 1960) comprising epidote, 
plagioclase, quartz, biotite (sometimes altered to chlorite), scarce muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite 
and sphene. The pink granite comprises microcline, quartz, scarce plagiocase, and abundant 
muscovite (but no biotite or epidote) together with magnetite, rutile and haematite as accessory 
minerals. This granite lacks xenoliths of Lufubu schist. Ten zircons from the Mufulira Pink Granite 
were analysed (Table 9, Fig. 24). The analyses plot along a discordia with an upper intercept of 
1993.7 ± 7.1  Ma  (MSWD = 1.05),  interpreted  as  the emplacement age.  The discordant data may

reflect a Pb-loss of Pb during a Pan-African metamorphic event or during recent weathering. The 
ages of the Mufulira Lufubu schists (1968 Ma) and the Mufulira Pink Granite, together with the 
fact that the Mufulira Grey Granodiorite contains xenoliths of Lufubu schists, indicate that the pink 
and grey granites are two separate intrusions emplaced at significantly different times. The Grey 
Granodiorite may be c. 1945 Ma in age following model 1 of Cahen et al. (1970c; see above).

Chambishi Granite (sample NN75/1) 
 
Borehole NN75 is located in the Chambishi South-East prospect 13 km NE of drill hole BN53. The 
total depth of bore hole NN75 is 1033.78m, and our sample was collected from a depth of 
1030.31m, 14 m below the nonconformable contact between the basal Roan Group sediments of the 
Katanga Supergroup, and an underlying granite which we call the Chambishi Granite. Sample 
NN75/1 is a medium- to coarse-grained, weakly foliated biotite granite (Table 10, Fig. 25). Fifteen 
zircons from NN75/1 were analysed (Table 11, Fig. 26). The analyses plot in a single cluster, 
yielding a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1983 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 1.12). This result is 
interpreted as the emplacement age of the Chambishi Granite.

Mulungushi Bridge augen gneiss (sample MFG-1) 
 
Sample MFG-1 is a megacrystic augen orthogneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge c. 20 km N of 
Kabwe  (Figs. 1 and 27). It forms part of the basement to the Irumide Belt, and contains a strong 
foliation, defined by biotite, which trends NNE-SSW, parallel to the trend of the Irumide Belt. 
Twelve zircons from the augen gneiss were analysed (Table 12, Fig. 28). The analysed zircons 
form a cluster which yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1976.2 ± 4.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.87). 
There are three main possibilities for the origin for the zircons which have been analysed from this 
sample: magmatic, magmatic with a metamorphic overgrowth rim, and completely metamorphic.  
Since the ages of all zircons analysed plot in a cluster, the possibility that the zircons are of 
magmatic origin with a metamorphic rim may be dismissed. Other samples of intrusives described 
in this paper give a range of ages of 2050-1960 Ma, with none showing any metamorphic influence 
at this time. The ages obtained from sample MFG-1 plot well within this range.  The preferred 
interpretation of the age 1976 Ma is that it represents the emplacement of the Mulungushi Gneiss 
protolith

Roan Group tuff (sample Etoile 1) 
 
The Mine de l’Etoile du Congo or “Star of the Congo Mine” is located 12 Km NE of Lubumbashi 
(DRC). The deposit was inferred by Lefebvre and Cailteux (1975) to be hosted within a thrust slice 
of the Roan Group, but has been reinterpreted by Wendorff (2003) to occur within olistostromal 
megaclasts of former Roan Group rocks within the syntectonic Fungurume Group. There is no 
outcrop of the basement, which is buried under kilometres of tectonically-thickened Katangan 
rocks. Tuffs occur within the lower part of the Roan Group and more particularly within the beds of 
the Serie des Mines, known locally as the red RAT, SD and CMN (Machairas, 1974; Auger, 1975; 
Lefebvre and Cailteux, 1975). Sample Etoile 1 is a dolomitic carbonate rock with interbedded thin

three zircons were found, which yielded 207Pb/206Pb ages of 2831 ± 16 Ma, 2802 ± 36 and 1858 ± 
24 Ma (Table 13). These ages are older than the maximum age of deposition of the Katangan 
sequence (880 Ma) and the three analysed zircons are inferred to be xenocrystics.

DISCUSSION 
 
The basement to the Katangan Sequence in the Lufilian Arc is only exposed in the Zambian 
Copperbelt. The sequence thickens significantly towards the Katanga Province of the DRC 
(Demesmaeker et al., 1963), where it is largely allochthonous and has been transported northwards 
along well-defined nappe structures (Jackson et al., 2003). The nature of the basement over the 
entire 700 km extent of the Lufilian Arc can nevertheless be gauged using a combination of igneous 
crystallization and xenocrystic zircon ages. The following sections discuss the main features of the 
Palaeoproterozoic basement and attempt to place the new data from this study into a regional 
tectonic context. 
 
Magmatic activity 
 
Data obtained during this study shed light on the evolution of the Copperbelt basement. The 
petrography and geochemistry of the Lufubu schists, located in four different areas of the 
Copperbelt, complemented by analyses taken from the literature, reveal that the precursors of the 
Lufubu schists are mainly volcanic in origin. Compositions range from andesite, rhyodacite-dacite 
to trachyandesite and alkali basalt, and analyses plot in the calc-alkaline field on an AFM diagram. 
Samples of Lufubu schists from this study also demonstrate a wide range of textures and 
compositions. In contrast, rocks from the Muva sequence in the Copperbelt are exclusively 
sedimentary in origin (Garlick, 1961b). Chemical analyses from the host rocks of the Samba Cu 
prospect suggest that they are volcanic in origin, and U-Pb zircon geochronology shows these rocks 
are of Palaeoproterozoic age. They must therefore be reclassified as Lufubu schist metavolcanics, 
and are not part of the Muva Supergroup [as previously regarded by Garrard (1965, 1996) and 
Wakefield (1978)]. This study shows that the ages of the four samples of Lufubu schist from 
Chambishi (Zambia), Mufulira (Zambia), Samba (Zambia) and Kinsenda (DRC) span a period of 
~106 Ma (1980 ± 7 Ma, 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma, 1964 ± 12 Ma and 1873.5 ± 8.3 Ma respectively). 
Granitoids and granitoid gneisses, likewise, yield ages ranging from 2048.8 ± 5.8 Ma (Mkushi) to 
1976.2 ± 4.8 Ma (Mulungushi) with intermediate events evident at 1993.7 ± 7.1 Ma (Mufulira) and 
at 1983 ± 5 Ma (Chambishi). The Lufubu schists record episodicity in the magmatic activity. 
Furthermore, the ages of the Lufubu schists together with the granitoids show that this magmatic 
activity was long-lived, spanning nearly 200 My, and was represented by both intrusive and 
extrusive phases. This is best illustrated from the Chambishi basin where error bars on the ages of 
the Lufubu schists and the intrusive Chambishi Granite overlap. A plausible regional interpretation 
of these Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline terrains is that they were formed in a long-lived magmatic 
arc or series of arcs as a result of the subduction of oceanic lithosphere between 2.1 and 1.8 Ga. We 
suggest the name “Lufubu Metamorphic Complex” for this extensive, deformed and 
metamorphosed Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane in the Copperbelt basement.  
 
Links with other Palaeoproterozoic terranes in the vicinity of the Congo Craton, and regional 
tectonic history 
 
The Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Copperbelt basement, consisting of the Lufubu schist 
metavolcanics and associated plutonic granitoids, is continuous to the north with the Bangweulu 
Block (Ngoyi et al., 1991) (Figs. 1 and 19). The granitoids and metavolcanics in the Bangweulu 
Block range in age from 1869 ± 20 to 1695 ± 43 Ma (Brewer et al., 1979; Schandelmeier et al., 
1981, 1983; Kabengele et al., 1990; see above). This range encompasses part of the age range 
obtained from the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex in this study (2049–1874 Ma). If we include the 
1750 ± 50 Ma age of the Roan Antelope Granite (Cahen et al., 1970c; see above), then the younger 
limits of the age ranges from both areas are comparable, whereas the Lufubu Metamorphic 
Complex has ages as old as ~ 2050 Ma, ~ 180 My older than the oldest dated rocks from the 
Bangweulu Block. However, it should be noted that all ages from the Bangweulu Block are Rb-Sr

whole-rock isochrons, which may not reflect the intrusive ages, and instead may record a younger 
overprint or post-emplacement cooling. Such a situation is clearly exhibited by the Mkushi Gneiss, 
which has a U-Pb age of 2049 ± 6 Ma (this study), and a Rb-Sr whole-rock age of 1777 ± 89 Ma 
(Ng’ambi et al., 1986). The calc-alkaline magmatic rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex 
show certain petrographical and geochemical similarities to the granitoids and porphyritic 
metavolcanic rocks of the Luapula Porphyries of the Bangweulu Block in northern Zambia 
(Abraham, 1959; Thieme, 1970, 1971), and the Moba, Pepa-Lubumba and Lumono complexes of 
the Marungu Plateau, DRC (Tshimanga and Lubala, 1990; Kabengele et al., 1990, 1991). Minor 
quartzite and schist interbeds within the Marungu metavolcanics (Buttgenbach, 1905) may be the 
equivalents of similar metasedimentary rocks interbedded with the Lufubu metavolcanic rocks in 
the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex (e.g., Mendelsohn, 1961b). 
 
To the west of the Copperbelt, the pre-Katangan basement rocks are exposed in several inliers in 
the Domes area of NW Zambia (Thieme and Johnson, 1981). Very imprecise dating of basement 
gneisses from the Mwombezhi dome has shown that the protoliths had ages of c. 1700 Ma, but 
were overprinted at c. 1200 Ma during the Irumide Orogeny (Cosi et al., 1992). In the Kabompo 
Dome of NW Zambia, the major pre-Katangan lithologies are biotite gneisses, augen gneisses, 
migmatites, foliated granites, feldspar-phyric biotite granite, mica schists and pegmatites (Klinck, 
1977; Liyungu and Njamu, 2000). Feldspar-phyric granites from the Kabompo Dome have yielded 
SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages of 1940 ± 2.8 Ma and 1934 ± 6 Ma (Key et al., 2001). In the Kalumbila 
Co-Ni-Cu deposit, detrital zircons from the Katangan metasedimentary host rocks have yielded 
SHRIMP U-Pb ages between 2004 and 1884 Ma, interpreted to reflect derivation from the 
Palaeoproterozoic granitic gneisses exposed in the adjacent Kabompo Dome (Steven and 
Armstrong, 2003). In the Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia, near the borders with Angola and the 
DRC, Key et al. (2001) have obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2058 ± 7 Ma for a porphyritic 
granite. This age is within error of the age of the Mkushi Gneiss (2049 ± 6 Ma) obtained in this 
paper. The age range of the basement rocks in the Domes and Mwinilunga areas of NW Zambia, as 
well as their lithological make up, thus indicates a strong similarity with the rocks of the Kafue 
anticline in the Copperbelt area, and with the granites and gneisses of the Mkushi-Mulungushi area, 
which collectively belong to the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex. Recently a granitic gneiss near 
Kapiri Mposhi yielded a U-Pb zircon emplacement age of 2730 Ma (De Waele and Fitzsimons, 
2004). This gneiss, which is situated between the Kafue anticline and the Mulungushi Gneiss, is 
here interpreted as a sliver of an exotic terrane within the Palaeoproterozoic arcs of the Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex. 
 
Farther west and southwest of the Kabompo Dome and Mwinilunga areas of Zambia, the Katangan 
rocks and their basement are buried under Phanerozoic Karoo and Kalahari sand cover of the 
Kalahari basin (Money, 1972; Thieme and Johnson, 1981). Interpretations of regional gravity and 
airborne magnetic surveys of western Zambia have shown that the structural trends of the basement 
rocks of western Zambia strike NE-SW, along a southwesterly prolongation of the trend of the 
western part of the Lufilian Arc (Saviaro, 1978, 1979). Gravity maps of NW Botswana (Reeves, 
1978; McMullan et al., 1995) and airborne magnetic maps of Botswana and Namibia (Reeves, 
1979; Eberle et al., 1996) show the smooth continuation of the Lufilian geophysical trends of 
western Zambia into the Damaran Belt of NW Botswana and northern Namibia, with no significant 
breaks. This implies a continuity of the basement terranes between Zambia and Namibia. In 
northwestern Botswana, the Quangwadum augen gneiss, from a basement inlier west of the 
Okavango delta, was recently dated at ~ 2050 Ma with the U-Pb technique on single zircons 
(Singletary et al., 2003). Further west, in NE Namibia, in the Tsumkwe inlier close to the Botswana 
border, Hoal et al. (2000) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2022 ± 15 Ma from a fine-
grained granitic gneiss. This age is not only similar to that of the Quangwadum Gneiss, but is also 
comparable to the ages of the Mwinilunga porphyritic granite and the Mkushi Gneiss from Zambia. 
Also in the Tsumkwe area, Hoal et al. (2000) have obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 852 ±

11 Ma for a megacrystic granite. This date falls within the age range defined by the Nchanga 
Granite (877 ± 10; Armstrong et al., 1999, 2005) and the Lusaka Granite (842 ± 33 Ma; 
recalculated from the data of Barr et al., 1977).  
 
In northern Namibia, west of the Tsumkwe area, the pre-Damaran basement, consisting of various 
granitoids, the Huab Gneisses, and the volcanosedimentary Khoabendus Group, is exposed in the 
Grootfontein, Kamanjab and Huab inliers (Clifford et al., 1962; Frets, 1969; Guj, 1970; Porada, 
1974). Limited age dating in the Kamanjab inlier (also known as the Franzfontein inlier) has 
revealed the existence of a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane having ages between ~ 1987 Ma 
and ~ 1662 Ma (Burger et al., 1976; Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985). Recently, a rhyolitic quartz 
porphyry of the Khoabendus Group in the Kamanjab inlier, has been dated at 1862 ± 6 Ma (Steven 
and Armstrong, 2002). In NW Namibia, the granitic augen gneiss of Ruacuna was dated at 1795 
+33/-29 Ma with the U-Pb technique on multigrain zircon fractions (Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985). 
In the Central Zone of the Damara Belt, north of the suture with the Kalahari Craton, pre-Damaran 
basement of the southernmost Congo Craton is exposed in the Abbabis inlier and in various smaller 
gneissic exposures (Jacob et al., 1978). Zircon fractions from the basement gneisses have yielded 
U-Pb concordia upper-intercept ages of 1925 +330/-280 Ma and 1945 ± 18 Ma, from the Abbabis 
Inlier and the Tumas Dome, respectively (Jacob et al., 1978; Burger and Jacob, unpublished data, 
in Kröner et al., 1991). Tack et al. (2002) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2038 ± 5 Ma 
from augen gneiss in the Ida Dome, and they also found c. 2050 Ma xenocrystic zircon cores 
occurring in c. 542 Ma Damaran granitoids. In the Khan Gorge near the Rössing uranium mine, 
Kröner et al. (1991) found xenocrystic zircon grains with ages of 2014 ± 39 Ma and 2093 ± 51 Ma 
from c. 1038 Ma and 1102 Ma granitoid gneisses, respectively. These various studies indicate that 
the pre-Damara basement of the southern Congo Craton is mainly Palaeoproterozoic, together with 
some late Mesoproterozoic components (Kröner et al., 1991), which are similar to those from the 
Irumide Belt. The age range of the Palaeoproterozoic basement, between 2093 ± 51 Ma and 1925 
+330/-280 Ma, is similar to that of the basement inliers of northern Namibia and NW Botswana. As 
was pointed out by Master (1990, 1993), all these terrains may form a continuum with the Domes 
area of NW Zambia, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Central African Copperbelt 
basement, and the Bangweulu Block and define a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc along the S and 
SE margin of the Congo Craton. We refer to this magmatic arc as the Kamanjab–Bangweulu 
terrane. 
 
The NW-SE trending Ubendian Belt, which separates the Bangweulu Block from the Archaean 
Tanzanian Craton (2930–2530 Ma in age; Pinna et al., 1996, 1999), is an orogenic belt dated at 
between c. 2000 and 1850 Ma (Schandelmeier, 1983; Lenoir et al., 1994; Boven et al., 1999). It 
consists of strongly sheared amphibolite-facies quartzofeldspathic ortho- and paragneisses, 
amphibolites, anorthosites, and granitoids, with subvertical foliations, which are found in several 
discrete fault-bounded terranes (Daly, 1988; Ring et al., 1997). The Ubendian Belt may be the 
result of the collision of the Kamanjab-Bangweulu magmatic arc terrane, or at least the Bangweulu 
Block, and the Tanzanian Craton. This collision occurred between 2000 and 1900 Ma (Ring et al., 
1997), and resulted in a foliation in Bangweulu Block granitoids. This was followed by the 
intrusion of post-tectonic granites, which are dated at 1869 ± 20 Ma, 1838 ± 43 Ma and 1824 ± 75 
Ma (Schandelmeier, 1981, 1983). The sedimentary Mporokoso Group unconformably overlies 
these granitoids, hence there is possibly no connection between it and the Mpanshya River Group 
in the Irumide Belt (which was deposited at 1880 ± 12 Ma), even though they were correlated by 
Daly and Unrug (1982) and De Waele and Mapani (2002). After being sutured in the Ubendian 
Belt, the Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane and Tanzanian Craton formed a single unified 
minicontinent, the “Kambantan” terrane (named acronymically after its component parts), which 
eventually was accreted onto the Kasai-Angola Block to form the southeastern and southern part of 
the enlarged Congo Craton. The Ubendian Belt suffered major re-activation during later Irumide 
and Pan-African tectonism (Daly, 1986; Theunissen et al., 1992).

In Zambia and the DRC, the Bangweulu Block is separated from the Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic 
(2900–2200 Ma; Delhal and Ledent, 1973; Delhal et al., 1976; Bassot et al., 1981) Kasai-Angola 
Block by the Mesoproterozoic (c. 1400-1000 Ma) Kibaran Belt. The Kibaran Belt, which consists 
of a thick pile of quartzitic and pelitic metasedimentary rocks and gneisses, together with intrusive 
granitoids, records a cycle of sedimentation followed by magmatic intrusion, collisional 
deformation and metamorphism, and post-tectonic granitic intrusion (Cahen et al., 1984). Earlier 
notions of an intracontinental rift setting for the Kibaran Belt (Klerkx et al., 1987) have now been 
superceded by evidence supporting the operation of a full Wilson cycle, involving rifting, ocean 
opening and closure, followed by subduction and collision (Kampunzu et al., 1986; Rumvegeri, 
1989, 1991; Kokonyangi et al., 2002). Burke (2003) has shown that the Kabanga-Musongati Line 
of mafic-ultramafic complexes, that separates the Eastern External and the Western Internal 
Domains of the NE Kibaran Belt (Tack et al., 1994), likely represents the deeply eroded roots of an 
Andean-type magmatic arc. Whereas the NE Kibaran Belt of Rwanda and Burundi is over 200 km 
wide, it tapers wedge-like to the SW into the DRC, and then disappears completely in the 
Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia, where recent mapping by Key et al. (2001) has shown that only 
Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks are present, with numerous NE-SW trending ductile shears 
and brittle fractures being the only representatives of possible Kibaran structures in this area. 
Farther west, these structures, together with all other basement rocks, are obscured by sedimentary 
cover of the Kalahari Basin of eastern Angola, for which no subsurface geophysical or borehole 
information is available. However, the southwestern continuation of the Kibaran trends can be 
followed to SW Angola, where the basement rocks emerge again. Here there is evidence that the 
Palaeoproterozoic rocks that characterise much of the Precambrian of southern Angola (Bassot et 
al., 1981; Carvalho et al., 2000; McCourt et al., 2004), have been overprinted during the Kibaran 
Orogeny (Carvalho et al., 1987). The Cunene Anorthosite Complex, which is regarded as a 
Grenvillian-type massif anorthosite (Ashwal and Twist, 1994), has recently been assigned Kibaran 
ages of 1370 ± 4 Ma and 1385.0 ± 7.6 Ma (Morais et al., 2000; Mayer et al., 2000; McCourt et al., 
2004), based on zircon U-Pb ages of a crosscutting co-genetic mangerite dyke.  
 
Recent metamorphic and geochronological work in the Epupa Gneisses south of the Kunene 
Anorthosite Complex has revealed the existence of two orogenic events here- a Kibaran event at c. 
1.3 Ga (Seth et al., 2001), and an earlier event, in the Epembe granulites, at c. 1500 Ma, which has 
not been recorded before in Central Africa (Seth et al., 2003). A hint at the existence of a more 
widespread c. 1000 Ma event in Central Africa is given by the presence of xenocrystic zircons 
dated at c. 1500 Ma in a Katangan lapilli tuff in the DRC (Rainaud et al., 2003). The c. 1500 Ma 
“Epembe” event, which involved burial of post-1630 Ma metapelites to the lower crust followed by 
rapid exhumation (Brandt et al., 2003), was probably a short-lived event, being a record of a brief 
encounter between the southern Kasai-Angola Block and an unknown terrane, speculated by Seth et 
al. (2003), to be possibly one of the few c. 1500 Ma terranes known worldwide, i.e., Rondonia 
(Brazil), the Pinwarian (Grenville Province, Canada) or the Gothian (Baltic Shield, Sweden). The c. 
1500 Ma event was then followed by the Kibaran cycle, between 1400 and 1000 Ma, which is 
represented in this area by the Orue Gneisses, dated at 1334 ± 21 Ma, and red granites from 
southern Angola (1411–1302 Ma, Rb-Sr ages; Bassot et al., 1981; Seth et al., 2001, 2003). 
 
In order to explain the apparent southwestwards disappearance of the Kibaran Belt in NW Zambia, 
and its re-appearance in SW Angola and NW Nambia, we propose that the Kibaran Belt has been 
overthrust by the Kambantan minicontinent when this terrane collided with the Kasai-Angola Block 
during the Kibaran Orogeny. Hence the apparent southwestwards wedging out of the Kibaran Belt 
is explained by progressive overthrusting by the Kambantan terrane late in the Kibaran Orogeny. 
This model is illustrated schematically in Figure 30. Section A-A’ shows a section from the Kasai-
Angola Block to the Bangweulu Block, north of the Lufilian Arc. Here the Kibaran 
metasedimentary  rocks  (part  of  which  formed a  passive margin to the Kasai-Angola Block)  are

shown as a deformed belt between the Kasai-Angola Block and the Kambantan terrane. Forming 
the cover of the Kambantan terrane, is the Mporokoso Group, overlain by the tabular Katangan 
sequence. In Section B-B’, which runs parallel to the first section, but further south, passing 
through the Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia and the Lufilian Arc, the contact between the Kasai-
Angola Block and the Kambantan terrane is a major thrust (corresponding to the NE-SW trending 
ductile shear zones with down-dip lineations mapped by Key et al., 2001), which has over-ridden, 
at depth, the deformed Kibaran metasedimentary belt together with its intrusive granitoids. Forming 
a cover to the Kambantan terrane in this section are the Muva Group and the tectonically thickened 
pile of Katangan sediments. Also shown on this section is the 3200–3000 Ma Likasi terrane, which 
is a cryptic terrane whose existence was revealed by the presence of Mesoarchaean xenocrystic 
zircons in Katangan lapilli tuffs from the central Lufilian Arc (Rainaud et al., 2003). In the 
Mwinilunga area, Key and Armstrong (2000) showed that zircons from 2540 Ma granites of the 
Kasai-Angola Block contained xenocrystic cores with ages up to 3154 Ma, interpreted by Rainaud 
et al. (2003) as being derived from the underlying Likasi terrane. Our section shows the inferred 
contact between the 2800–2400 Ma high-grade (granulite facies) gneisses of the Kasai-Angola 
Block, and the Mesoarchaean Likasi cryptic terrane, which underlies the Neoarchaean (2540–2530 
Ma) granitic gneisses dated by Key et al. (2001), as well as the Kibaran Belt. The post-Muva, pre-
Katangan plutonism of the Nchanga Granite is also indicated on the section. A late Kibaran age for 
the major thrust underlying the Kambantan terrane is constrained by the presence of a population of 
xenocrystic Kibaran-aged zircons (1273 ± 46 to 1018 ± 27 Ma) located in the same pyroclastic 
layer from the Katangan sequence that contains the Mesoarchaean zircons from the Likasi terrane 
(Rainaud et al., 2003). If the thrusting of the Kambantan terrane over the Kibaran Belt occurred 
later, during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny (which post-dated the deposition of the Katanga 
Supergroup), then no Kibaran-aged xenocrystic zircons would have been present in the Katangan 
tuffs. 
 
Following the accretion of the Kambantan terrane onto the southern part of the Congo Craton 
during the Kibaran Orogeny, another series of terranes collided outboard of this, to produce the 
Irumide Belt, whose metamorphic peak was at c. 1050 to 1020 Ma (Schenk and Appel, 2001, 2002; 
De Waele et al., 2003). Irumide-aged gneisses (Kröner et al., 1991, see above) and metavolcanics 
(Steven et al., 2000) are also found in inliers of the southern Congo Craton within the central 
Damara Belt of Namibia and in NW Botswana (Kampunzu et al., 1998; Singletary et al., 2003),

indicating that the Irumide Orogeny was more extensively developed on the southern margin of the 
Congo Craton. The Irumide terranes include supra-subduction zone magmatic rocks and small 
Archaean microcontinental slivers dated at c. 2600 Ma (Johnson and Rivers, 2004; Johnson et al., 
2004; Mapani et al., 2004). The lack of syn-collision-related granitoid magmatism, together with 
the high temperature-low pressure metamorphism, suggests that the Irumide Belt formed in an 
active Andean or Cordilleran type setting (Johnson and Rivers, 2004; Johnson et al., 2004). Many 
of these Irumide terranes in the southern part of the Congo Craton (north of the Mwembeshi 
dislocation zone) rifted away during the opening of the Khomas ocean at c. 750–730 Ma (Hoffman, 
1994), to form a rifted passive margin of the Congo Craton, in which Damaran and Katangan 
sediments were deposited.  
 
During the Pan-African Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, the Khomas ocean closed with subduction of 
oceanic lithosphere underneath the Congo Craton margin, leading to the formation of an Andean-
type magmatic arc, and ultimately to the Himalayan-type collision between the Congo and Kalahari 
Cratons at about 550–510 Ma (Miller, 1983; Porada and Berhorst, 2000).  Eclogites and talc-
kyanite whiteschists formed during the collision record extremely high pressures, compatible with a 
closure of an ocean at least 1000 km wide (John et al., 2003). Thus models for the formation of the 
Damara-Lufilian-Zambezi orogen due to the collision of the Congo and Kalahari Cratons (Burke et 
al., 1973) are being vindicated, at the expense of models which regard the Katangan-Damaran 
sequences as having formed in interlinked intracontinental rifts or narrow ocean basins (e.g., 
Hanson et al., 1994; Hanson, 2003). One of the reasons why Hanson (2003) supported the 
intracontinental rift model was the apparent continuity of the Irumide Belt into the Choma-Kalomo 
Belt, across the Neoproterozoic Zambezi Belt. Recent age dating has shown that the Irumide and 
Choma-Kalomo Belts have dissimilar ages, differing by up to 200 My, and that postulates of their 
former continuity are invalid (De Waele et al., 2003; Johnson and Rivers, 2004). Hence, earlier 
models which attempted to link the Palaeoproterozoic basement of the Central African Copperbelt 
with terranes that are now a part of the Kalahari Craton, (such as a magmatic arc extending to the 
Richtersveld region of southern Namibia,  with the Kheis and Magondi Belts being back-arc basins 
to this arc; Master, 1990, 1993), are now regarded as being invalid.  
 
In NW Namibia, the N-S trending Kaoko Belt marks the site of a transpressive collision between 
the Congo Craton and the Rio de la Plata Craton of South America (Dürr and Dingledey, 1996; 
Goscombe et al., 2003), and it may have preceded the closure of the Khomas sea in the NE-
trending Damara Belt (Prave, 1996). U-Pb zircon age dating has revealed the presence of 
Palaeoproterozoic (c. 1978-1933 Ma) basement rocks within this belt, as well as rocks which are as 
old as 2645–2585 Ma (Seth et al., 1998), and as young as 1530–1500 Ma (Kröner et al., 2002). The 
Archaean ages from this belt are regarded as coming from rocks that are part of an accreted exotic 
terrane that originated probably in the Rio de la Plata Craton and was left behind in Africa after the 
opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Palaeoproterozoic ages probably reflect the age of the 
Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane, which formed the basement as well as the foreland of the Kaoko 
Orogeny. 
 
Inherited zircons 
 
Five samples in our study showed signs of inheritance of older zircons. The sample LufMuf, a 
Lufubu schist from Mufulira, showed four zircon ages which are older than the 1968 ± 9 Ma 
emplacement age of the Lufubu schists. One zircon yielded a 207Pb/206Pb age of 2174 ± 13 Ma and 
the three remaining zircons yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057 ± 9 Ma. The oldest 
zircon reveals the presence of crustal components as old as 2170 Ma, while the three younger 
zircons have an age comparable to that of the Mkushi Gneiss, indicating that rocks of the age of the 
Mkushi Gneiss precursor were more widespread, and formed part of the source region, or were in 
the path of ascent of the magmas that produced the precursor volcanic rocks of the Lufubu schists.  

--- Page 44 ---
 
40
The cores of zircons from the Mtuga Aplite sample APL-1, from the Mkushi Mine, yielded a range 
of 207Pb/206Pb ages between 2072 ± 9 Ma and 2009 ± 4 Ma. Zircons from Mtuga aplite sample 
APL-2 have inherited cores that range in age mainly from 2064 ± 15 to 1998 ± 18 Ma, with two 
older ages of 2730 ± 7 and 2688 ± 8 Ma. The age range of the zircon cores from the two aplites 
encompasses the age of the 2049 Ma Mkushi Gneiss, as well as the 2050–2020 Ma range of detrital 
zircon core ages from the Serenje paragneisses and migmatites north of Mkushi (De Waele and 
Mapani, 2002). Hence, the zircon cores from the Mtuga aplites are interpreted as being xenocrystic 
and may be inherited from a protolith similar to the Serenje Gneisses and migmatites, which 
underwent partial melting. Omenetto (1973, 1974) had argued earlier that the mineralized aplites 
from the Mkushi area were derived from “granitization”, regarded as the time as melting, of a 
sedimentary paragneiss precursor which contained disseminated Cu mineralization which was 
partitioned into the granitic melt.  
 
The two Neoarchaean zircon cores from APL-2, at 2730 ± 7 Ma and 2688 ± 8 Ma, are the only 
Archaean xenocrysts found in any of the basement granitoids. If, as argued above, the aplites are 
derived from partial melting of a metasedimentary paragneiss precursor, then the Archaean zircons 
would have to have been part of the detrital zircon population in the metasediment. The two 
Archaean zircon core ages are also similar to the ages of detrital monazites found in Irumide 
quartzites from the Irumi Hills (near Mkushi), and the Changwena Hill (SW of Serenje), which 
have respectively been dated at 2720 ± 24 Ma and 2720 ± 20 Ma (Snelling et al., 1964). The source 
of these Archaean detrital zircons and monazites is likely to be the newly discovered gneisses at 
Kampoya quarry, some 40 km northwest of Mkushi Mine, which have been dated at 2730 Ma (De 
Waele and Fitzsimons, 2004). The ages of detrital zircons and monazites in the Irumide Belt also 
correspond with the ages of detrital zircons found in the Muva quartzite south of Mufulira in the 
Copperbelt, which range from 1991 to 3180 Ma, including a cluster of ages between 2708 ± 18 and 
2463 ± 25 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2003). However, Mesoarchaean zircons dated between 3200 to 3000 
Ma, which are present in the Muva quartzites near Mufulira, are absent from the detrital population 
in quartzites and paragneisses in the Irumide Belt (De Waele and Fitzsimons, 2004), as well as in 
the xenocrystic zircon population in aplites derived by partial melting of the Irumide 
metasediments. This suggests that the detrital zircon populations in the Muva quartzites have a 
different origin from those in the Irumide quartzites and paragneisses. The Muva quartzites of the 
Copperbelt include detrital components from the Mesoarchaean Likasi terrane of the southern 
Congo Craton (Rainaud et al., 2003), and could only have been deposited after the amalgamation of 
the Kambantan terrane with the Congo Craton during the Kibaran Orogeny. Thus, despite 
containing no detrital zircons younger than 1941 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2003), the Muva in the 
Copperbelt may represent some kind of post-orogenic molasse deposit following the Kibaran 
Orogeny. 
 
Sample CT169/1256, from the Samba prospect, yielded three inherited zircons dated at 2423 ± 13, 
2336 ± 9 and 2160 ± 25 Ma respectively. The youngest of these xenocrystic zircons (2160 ± 25 
Ma) has an age similar to the oldest xenocryst from Mufulira, dated at 2174 ± 13 Ma, and is likely 
to be derived from a similar source. The two older xenocrysts from Samba indicate the presence of 
crustal components as old as 2420–2330 Ma in the source region, or in the path of ascent, of the 
magmas that produced the precursor volcanic rocks to the Samba Lufubu schists.  
 
Fine pyroclastic layers from the Neoproterozoic Katangan sequence (sample Etoile 1) yielded two 
Mesoarchaean zircons at 2831 ± 16 Ma and 2802 ± 36 Ma and one Palaeoproterozoic zircon at 
1858 ± 24 Ma. As is the case for Archaean zircons in tuffs from the overlying Mwashya Group, the 
two Archaean zircons from the Etoile 1 tuff sample may be derived from cryptic Archaean terranes 
which have been tectonically overridden by the Lufilian arc, such as the Likasi terrane, or other 
portions of the Congo Craton (Rainaud et al., 2003). Ages of c. 2800 Ma have been found in the 
southern exposed part of the Congo Craton in the Kasai region (Delhal et al., 1976). A xenocrystic 

--- Page 45 ---
 
41
zircon dated at 2839 ± 22 Ma was reported from a foliated Archaean granite in the Mwinilunga area 
of NW Zambia, which had an intrusive age of 2538 ± 10 Ma (Key et al., 2001). The third zircon, in 
the Etoile 1 sample, with an age of 1858 Ma, is clearly derived from the Palaeoproterozoic 
basement of the Copperbelt, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex.  
 
Inherited zircons from the Samba porphyry and Mufulira Lufubu schists may derive from cryptic 
terranes ranging in age from 2400 Ma to 2100 Ma. No rocks of such an age have yet been dated 
from the Copperbelt basement. Finally, no sample of the Lufubu schists or the Palaeoproterozoic 
granitoids has yielded xenocrystic zircons with Archaean ages. This suggests that the protoliths of 
the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex developed as juvenile crust far from older continental 
influences, in an oceanic island arc environment rather than in an Andean-type arc.  
 
Nd and Pb isotopic studies of Damaran metasedimentary and granitoid rocks by Hawkesworth et al. 
(1981) and Hawkesworth and Marlow (1983) indicate these rocks were derived from basement 
rocks up to 2000 Ma in age, and suggest an absence of any significantly older crust beneath the 
Damara Orogen. However, just as the detrital zircons from the Muva cover rocks of the Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex have much older ages, indicating partial derivation from an Archaean 
terrane (Rainaud et al., 2003), so also do detrital zircons from Damaran cover rocks have much 
older ages than their immediate basement. Jacob et al. (2000) have dated detrital zircons from the 
Damaran metasediments that host the Navachab gold deposit in the Karibib District, and have 
obtained SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 2872 ± 4 Ma, 2870 ± 6 Ma, 2428 ± 9 Ma, 2360 ± 5 Ma, and 1962 
± 10 Ma. The c. 2800–2400 Ga ages are similar to ages obtained from the Congo Craton in Kasai, 
DRC (Delhal and Ledent, 1973; Delhal et al., 1976), and they also encompass the age range of 
xenocrystic zircons from the Samba metavolcanics and the Katangan pyroclastics from the 
Copperbelt (see above). This may suggest that by the time the Neoproterozoic Katangan and 
Damaran sedimentation occurred, the Kambantan terrane had already been sutured to the Archaean 
Kasai-Angola Block, from which detrital components were shed into cover sequences on the 
younger terrane. Although no Archaean detrital zircons have yet been found in the Katanga 
Supergroup (Master et al., 2005), detrital platinoids in Katangan sediments at Mutoshi in the 
Kolwezi area have been inferred to be derived from the Archaean Kasai-Angola Block (Jedwab, 
1997). In these same Katangan sediments, Jedwab (1997) also reported detrital cassiterite grains 
which were probably derived from erosion of late Kibaran tin-granites. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The basement to the Katangan Supergroup in the Central African Copperbelt consists of the Lufubu 
schists and various granitoids and gneisses, which constitute the newly defined Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex. The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc-alkaline volcanic arc 
sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yield 
ages of 1980 ± 7, 1968 ± 9, 1964 ± 12 and 1874 ± 8 Ma. The Mkushi granitic gneiss from south-
east of the Zambian Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 ± 6 Ma. An augen gneiss, from the Mulungushi 
Bridge locality, yielded an emplacement age of 1976 ± 5 Ma. More evolved granitoids from the 
Copperbelt itself, the Mufulira Pink Granite and the Chambishi Granite, gave ages of 1994 ± 7 and 
1983 ± 5 Ma respectively. These gneisses, granitoids and acid-intermediate calc-alkaline 
metavolcanics are considered to represent stages in the evolution of a magmatic arc or several arcs 
that formed episodically over a 200 million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. The 
undeformed, copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut the foliation in the Mkushi 
gneisses, have xenocrystic cores similar in age to the gneisses, with overgrowths dated at 1059 ± 26 
Ma, regarded as the age of igneous emplacement of these aplites, which thus intruded during the 
Irumide Orogeny.

We interpret the rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex as belonging to a regionally extensive 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and 
the Marungu Plateau of the DRC, the Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane, which collided with the 
Archaean Tanzanian Craton during the c. 2000–1900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new 
composite minicontinental entity that we term the “Kambantan” terrane. The Kambantan terrane 
was accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the Mesoproterozoic c. 1400–
1000 Ma Kibaran Orogeny. The outboard side of the Kambantan terrane was the site of the c. 
1050–1020 Ma Irumide Orogeny, caused by the collision of several terranes with the Congo 
Craton. Part of the Irumide Belt subsequently rifted off at c. 750–730 Ma, leading to the formation 
of a rifted passive margin during sedimentation of the Damara and Katanga Supergroups, and the 
opening of an ocean basin which closed during the Pan-African Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, when 
the Congo and Kalahari Cratons were sutured together.

GEOCHRONOLOGY AND NATURE OF THE PALAEOPROTEROZOIC 
BASEMENT IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT (ZAMBIA AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO), WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age data, together with geochemical analyses, from the basement to the 
Katanga Supergroup in the Central African Copperbelt reveal the existence of a widespread 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane. The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc-
alkaline volcanic arc sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic 
of Congo (DRC), yield ages of 1980 ± 7, 1968 ± 9, 1964 ± 12 and 1874 ± 8 Ma. The oldest 
dated unit from the region, the Mkushi granitic gneiss from southeast of the Zambian 
Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 ± 6 Ma. The copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut 
the foliation in the Mkushi Gneisses, have mainly xenocrystic, zoned zircons with cores dated 
at c. 2070–2000 Ma. Overgrowths on these cores are dated at 1059 ± 26 Ma, which is 
interpreted as the intrusive age of the aplites. An augen gneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge 
locality yielded an emplacement age of 1976 ± 5 Ma. The Mufulira Pink Granite has an age of 
1994 ± 7 Ma, while the Chambishi Granite has been dated at 1983 ± 5 Ma, an age within error 
of Lufubu schist metavolcanics from elsewhere in the Chambishi basin. The gneisses, 
granitoids and acid-intermediate, calc-alkaline metavolcanics are considered to represent 
stages in the evolution of one or more magmatic arcs that formed episodically over a 200 
million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. We suggest naming this assemblage of rocks 
the “Lufubu Metamorphic Complex”. The rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex are 
interpreted to be part of a regionally extensive Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane 
stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and the DRC. This terrane is termed the 
Kamanjab-Bangweulu arc and is inferred to have collided with the Archaean Tanzanian 
Craton during the c. 2000–1900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new composite 
minicontinental entity that we term the “Kambantan” terrane. The Kambantan terrane was 
accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the c. 1400–1000 Ma Kibaran 
Orogeny.

GEOCHRONOLOGY AND NATURE OF THE PALAEOPROTEROZOIC BASEMENT IN 
THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT (ZAMBIA AND THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO), WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Central African Copperbelt is a world-class stratabound Cu-Co metallogenic province, hosted 
by Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup. It extends from the Zambian 
Copperbelt to the Congolese Copperbelt in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) (Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961a). Much of the age data relating to the Central 
African Copperbelt was produced in the period 1960-1980 using Rb-Sr and K-Ar techniques 
(Cahen et al., 1984). The existing data are generally imprecise and their interpretation 
controversial. In the mid-1990s a project was undertaken using the ion-microprobe U-Pb single 
zircon technique to provide more accurate time constraints on the Central African Copperbelt. In 
this study we present new data related to the basement of the Katangan and discuss their 
significance in terms of the evolution of the Central African Copperbelt. An accompanying paper 
(Master et al., 2005) presents additional constraints on the provenance ages of the Katanga 
Supergroup, while the ages of metamorphic events that have affected the Katangan metasediments 
are presented in Rainaud et al. (2005). 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND PREVIOUS GEOCHRONOLOGY 
 
The Katanga Supergroup was deformed during the Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic eras into an 
arcuate fold-thrust belt known as the Lufilian Arc. It unconformably overlies a fertile basement 
which has long been recognised as also containing widespread copper mineralization (Pienaar, 
1961; Wakefield, 1978). To the west, the Lufilian Arc is flanked by the c. 1400-1000 Ma Kibaran 
Belt, which separates it from the Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Kasai-Angola 
Block, which forms part of the larger Congo Craton (Cahen et al. 1984; Delhal, 1991; Tack et al., 
1999). To the southeast, the Lufilian Arc is flanked by the Mesoproterozoic Irumide Belt (Daly et 
al., 1984).  
 
Although the Central African Copperbelt extends through both the Democratic Republic of Congo 
and Zambia and has a strike length of 700 km in the Lufilian Arc (Figs. 1, 2), the pre-Katangan 
basement is mainly exposed in Zambia and immediately adjacent areas of the Democratic Republic 
of Congo (Brock, 1961; Demesmaeker et al., 1963). This fact, and other lithological and structural 
factors, led François (1974) to distinguish two provinces in the Central African Copperbelt: (1) the 
Zambian Province, extending from Zambia to the Congolese deposits close to the border (such as 
Musoshi and Kinsenda); and (2) the Congolese Province, extending from Lubumbashi to Kolwezi. 
Anticline (Garlick, 1961a). In adjacent areas of Katanga, basement exposures are found in the 
Konkola, Luina and Mokambo Domes (Gysin, 1933; Lecompte, 1933). About half of the pre-
Katangan basement consists of the Lufubu schists, and the rest consists mainly of a variety of 
supposedly intrusive granitoids (Gray, 1929; Mendelsohn, 1961b, c). Some of these granitoids were 
previously regarded as also being intrusive into the Katangan sequence, but this was disproven by 
Garlick  and Brummer (1951), who  showed that all  granites in the Copperbelt are of pre-Katangan  
age, and are unconformably overlain by Katangan rocks. Post-Katangan intrusive granitoids form 
several plutons in the western and southern exposed parts of the Lufilian Arc in Zambia (Thieme 
and  Johnson, 1981) and  in the Hook massif and  adjacent areas of the inner part of the Lufilian 
Arc. In the Zambian Province, the basement rocks are exposed in a structural high known as the 
Kafue (Hanson et al., 1993). The granitoids  intrusive  into  the Lufubu schists were first dated by     
Cahen et al. (1968,  1970 b,  c) using  bulk zircon  U-Pb  dating,  and  were  shown  to  represent  a

Palaeoproterozoic magmatic suite with imprecise ages spanning 2018–1702 Ma (Cahen et al., 
1984). Cahen et al. (1970c) dated the Grey Granodiorite at Mufulira using two near-concordant 
bulk zircon fractions. Depending on whether Pb-loss was assumed to be at zero age (model 1), or 
whether it occurred during the Kibaran Orogeny at c. 1300 Ma (model 2), they obtained model ages 
of 1945 Ma (model 1) to 2018 Ma (model 2) for the Mufulira Grey Granodiorite (Cahen et al., 
1984). The Roan Antelope Granite at Luanshya yielded a (recalculated) 207Pb/206Pb isochron age, 
based on four bulk zircon fractions, of 1702 Ma (Cahen et al., 1970c; 1984). Cliff and Clemmey 
(1976) obtained a Rb-Sr model age of c. 2000 Ma on muscovite from a pegmatite cutting basement 
rocks at Mindola Mine. A granitoid from the Luina Dome in the DRC, close to the Zambian 
Copperbelt, has been dated at 1882 +23/-19 Ma (Ngoyi et al., 1991). The Lufubu schists were 
constrained to be older than 2049 ± 103 Ma to 2198 ± 108, based on a model Rb-Sr age of a post-
Lufubu, pre-Katangan pegmatite, with assumed initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the range 0.705 to 0.710 
(Cahen et al., 1970a, 1984).  
 
The Palaeoproterozoic basement rocks of the Copperbelt extend northwards to the Luapula 
Province of Zambia and the Marungu Plateau of the DRC, southwest of Lake Tanganyika, where 
they constitute the basement of the Bangweulu Block (Drysdall et al., 1972; Brewer et al., 1979; 
Kabengele et al., 1990; Andersen and Unrug, 1984). Brewer et al. (1979) obtained Rb-Sr isochron 
ages of 1816 ± 22 Ma and 1833 ± 18 Ma, for a rhyolite and a granitoid from the western part of the 
Bangweulu Block. These rocks have relatively low initial 86Sr/86Sr ratios (Ri) of 0.70328 and 
0.70327,  respectively,  indicating  a  similar source  in  the  juvenile  crust  or  upper  mantle. In the

Marungu Plateau, three intrusive complexes have yielded whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron ages of 1863 
± 53 Ma, 1861 ± 28 Ma and 1695 ± 43 Ma, with Ri = 0.70277, 0.7026 and 0.70436 respectively 
(Kabengele et al., 1990). In northeast Zambia, granitoids of the Bangweulu Block have yielded 
whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron ages of 1869 ± 20 Ma, 1838 ± 43 Ma and 1824 ± 75 Ma 
(Schandelmeier, 1981, 1983).  
 
To the southeast of the Copperbelt, the Irumide Belt of northeast Zambia consists of quartzites and 
metapelites of the Manshya River Group, together with syntectonic to late-tectonic granitoid 
plutons, amphibolite-facies gneisses, and migmatites (Daly, 1986; Tembo et al., 2002; De Waele 
and Mapani, 2002). A metarhyolite interbedded with metasediments from the northern part of the 
belt in the Chinsali area has yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1880 ± 12 Ma, which gives the 
depositional age for the Manshya River Group (De Waele and Mapani, 2002). Syn- to late-tectonic 
intrusive granitoids in the Irumide Belt are dated at between 1046 ± 77 Ma and 953 ± 19 Ma, with a 
metamorphic peak at c. 1020 Ma (De Waele et al., 2003; SHRIMP U-Pb single zircon dates). 
Monazite growth at ultrahigh-temperature peak metamorphic conditions (T = 875°– 900°C; P ~ 6 
kb) took place at 1046 ± 3 Ma in garnet-cordierite gneisses in the eastern Irumide Belt near Chipata 
(Schenk and Appel, 2001, 2002). The basement to the Irumide Belt consists partly of granitoid 
gneisses referred to as the Mkushi Gneisses. These are intruded by the Mtuga granites and 
associated aplites (which are mineralized with Cu at the Mkushi Mine; Legg, 1976). The Mkushi 
Gneisses yielded a whole-rock Rb-Sr date of 1777 ± 89 Ma, while the Mtuga Granite yielded a date 
of 607 ± 39 Ma (N’gambi et al., 1986). A model Rb-Sr age of 1693 ± 50 Ma (assuming Ri = 0.709) 
was obtained for an aplite from Mkushi (Cahen and Snelling, 1966; recalculated by Cahen et al., 
1984).  Recent SHRIMP zircon dating by De Waele et al. (2003) of the Lukamfwa Hill granitic 
gneisses, between Mkushi and Serenje in the western part of the central Irumide Belt, yielded ages 

--- Page 8 ---

between 1664 ± 9 Ma and 1639 ± 14 Ma. Other gneissic granites from the northern Irumide Belt 
have yielded zircon ages of 1592 ± 43 Ma and 1519 ± 19 Ma (De Waele et al., 2003).  
 
In the Copperbelt region, the Lufubu schists and the intrusive granitoids are unconformably 
overlain by quartzites and schists of the Muva Supergroup (Garlick, 1961b). The Muva 
metasediments have a maximum age of 1941 ± 40 Ma, which is the age of the youngest detrital 
zircon dated by Rainaud et al. (2003) from these sediments. The youngest pre-Katangan intrusive 
in the basement is the Nchanga Granite, with a SHRIMP zircon age of 877 ± 10 Ma, which gives 
the maximum age for Katangan sedimentation (Armstrong et al., 1999, 2005).  
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
Major element analyses were performed using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry on a Philips 
spectrometer, in the Department of Geology, School of Geosciences, University of the 
Witwatersrand.  Major elements were determined using the fusion technique of Norrish and Hutton 
(1969). Trace element analyses were done on pressed powder pellets by XRF using the method of 
Feather and Willis (1976). 
 
The separation of zircons was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, Johannesburg, using 
conventional techniques. The separated zircons were examined and characterised in term of 
uranium contents using the cathodoluminescence technique. All zircons were randomly selected for 
analysis, but the locations of the analysed spots were chosen to avoid areas of anomalously high or 
low uranium contents. U-Pb analyses were performed on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion 
Microprobe (SHRIMP) I and II at the Australian National University, Canberra. The SHRIMP 
analytical procedure used in this study is similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). 
Age calculations and plotting of analytical data were carried out using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) 
and all ages are quoted with errors at the 1σ level.  
 
RESULTS 
 
A total of eleven samples were dated for the purposes of this study, representing Lufubu schist 
metavolcanics (4 samples), and granitoids and granitoid gneisses (7 samples) from the basement to 
the Katanga Supergroup of the Central African Copperbelt and from an adjacent area in the Irumide 
Belt. Nine of these samples were collected in Zambia and two in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (Figs. 1, 2). 
 
Lufubu schists 
 
Gray (1929) first differentiated highly deformed Lufubu schists and gneisses from overlying Muva 
metasedimentary rocks. Jackson (1932) called the Lufubu schists of the Nchanga area the 
“Basement Schist Series”, consisting of garnetiferous chlorite schists, quartz-mica schists and 
biotite gneisses, which he regarded as being metasedimentary in origin and Archaean in age. 
Mendelsohn (1961b) described the Lufubu schists as mica schists, quartzites and gneisses with 
minor metamorphosed carbonates, conglomerates, subgreywackes and arkoses, extensively 
intruded by granites. He regarded the majority of the Lufubu schists as metasediments with the 
possibility of some minor metavolcanics. Unconformably overlying the Lufubu schists are the 
Muva metasediments, which consist of deformed quartzites, metaconglomerates and metapelitic 
schists (Garlick, 1961b).

Geochemistry of the Lufubu schists 
 
Whole-rock geochemistry was undertaken on Lufubu schists from the Mwambashi B prospect in 
the Chambishi basin, Baluba Mine near Luanshya, the Kafue River south of Mufulira (Fig. 3) and 
from Kinsenda in the DRC. Samples were analysed for both major and trace elements (Table 1), 
and were examined petrographically for their mineralogical and textural characteristics. All 
samples present porphyritic textures with fine-grained matrices of metamorphic sericite. Lufubu 
schist compositions are presented in a Zr/TiO2 vs Nb/Y diagram (Winchester and Floyd, 1977) (Fig. 
4) which shows that these rocks plot in the andesite/ rhyodacite-dacite/ trachyandesite/ alkali basalt 
domain. The sample suite has characteristics consistent with a metavolcanic origin. The same 
analyses together with those from the host rocks of the Samba porphyry (Wakefield, 1978) are 
plotted in the AFM geochemical discrimination diagram of Irvine and Baragar (1971) (Fig. 5). All 
analyses show enrichments in the alkalis Na2O+K2O compared to FeO, and they plot in the calc-
alkaline field. Because these rocks may have suffered mobility of major elements during 
metamorphism, the AFM plot can only be used to suggest that the data are consistent with the 
Lufubu schists being mainly calc-alkaline metavolcanic rocks. The Lufubu schist metavolcanic 
rocks, together with subordinate metasedimentary rocks such as quartzites and marbles, are 
regarded as having formed in a subduction-related magmatic arc.  
 
Mufulira Lufubu schist (sample LufMuf) 
 
Sample LufMuf was collected from the Mufulira Mine, on the eastern flank of the Kafue anticline 
(Fig. 2). It is a blastoporphyritic metavolcanic derived from a hornblende-quartz porphyry in which 
the fine-grained matrix and amphibole-phenocrysts are replaced by intergrowths of epidote, biotite, 
chlorite, quartz magnetite and sphene (Fig. 6). Fourteen analyses were undertaken on 14 zircons 
from this sample. Cathodoluminescence images and plane-polarised photomicrographs (Fig. 7) 
show three types of zircons; euhedral, broken and abraded. All zircons exhibit an oscillatory zoning 
consistent with an igneous origin. The c-axes of the zircons are up to 200 µm in length. Euhedral 
zircons represent more than 50% of the entire population. Results of the analyses are reported in 
Table 2 and plotted on a concordia diagram in Figure 8. Two distinct populations and one older 
single zircon (zircon no. 8 on the CL image and in Table 2) are evident. The oldest zircon yields a 
207Pb/206Pb age of 2174 ± 13 Ma. The older of the two main populations includes three zircons 
(zircons no. 1, 5 and 11), all broken pieces, which yield a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057 ± 
9 Ma (MSWD = 1.8). It is unclear whether these zircons were broken during their incorporation as 
xenocrysts, or if they were broken during sample preparation. The youngest population consists of 
ten zircons (zircons no. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 on the CL image and in Table 2) and 
yielded an average mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma with a MSWD = 1.6. On the CL 
image, these ten zircons are euhedral. An attempt at differentiating the three populations of zircons 
by plotting age versus Th/U ratio was made (Fig. 9). Th/U results from the youngest population 
(mean age at 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma) are scattered and vary between 0.36 and 2.18. The group of three 
broken zircons plots between 0.63 and 0.88. The oldest single zircon has the lowest Th/U ratio of 
0.34. Thus, there appears to be an inverse exponential trend between age and Th/U ratios; however, 
no definitive interpretation can be made, as the data set is not large enough. The age of the 
youngest population (1968 ± 9 Ma) is interpreted as the age of the protolith of the Lufubu 
metavolcanics at Mufulira. This interpretation is consistent with the igneous characteristics of the 
dated grains. The four older zircons are regarded as inherited. 
 
Kinsenda meta-trachyandesite (sample KNS1) 
 
Sample KNS1 was collected at Kinsenda Mine (DRC) on the southern flank of the Luina Dome 
near the border with Zambia (Figs. 2 and 10). It is a metatrachyandesitic porphyry with relic alkali-

feldspar phenocrysts showing perthitic texture (Fig. 11). Feldspar phenocrysts are quite deformed 
(some are kinked) and the matrix of biotite and muscovite shows two generations of metamorphic 
muscovite. Cathodoluminescence imaging shows that the zircons are large (Fig. 12), with the long 
axis ≥ 200 µm. All zircons exhibit an oscillatory zoning consistent with an igneous origin. Sixteen 
analyses were undertaken on 15 zircons (Table 3, Fig. 13). All analyses are concordant or less than 
15% discordant and plot in a single cluster. All the analyses yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb 
age of 1873.5 ± 8.3 Ma (MSWD = 1.7). This age is interpreted as the igneous age of the 
trachyandesitic protolith of the Lufubu schist at Kinsenda.

Chambishi meta-trachyandesite (sample BN53/1) 
 
Borehole BN53 is located in a prospect area called Mwambashi B, on the western flank of the 
Chambishi Basin (Fig. 2). The total depth of this drill hole is 693.43 m, and the sample was 
collected from a depth of 685.35 m, ~20 m below the contact with basal Katangan sediments. 
BN53/1 is interpreted as a trachyandesitic metavolcanic quartz porphyry with relict deformed 
quartz and plagioclase phenocrysts (Table 1), which was transformed into a blastoporphyritic 
biotite-sericite schist (Fig. 14). Ten zircons from BN53/1 were analysed (Table 4, Fig. 15). The 
analyses plot in a single cluster and their weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age is 1980 ± 7 Ma (MSWD = 
0.55). This result is interpreted as the igneous age of the protolith volcanic rock.

Samba felsic metavolcanic schist (sample CT169/1256) 
 
The Samba prospect is the largest copper deposit located in the basement of the Central African 
Copperbelt and consists of disseminations, stringers and veinlets of copper sulphides in quartz-
sericite schists derived from porphyritic igneous rocks of quartz monzonite to granodioritic 
composition (Wakefield, 1978). Ore resources have been estimated at fifty million tons with an 
overall grade of about 0.5% Cu (Wakefield, 1978). The Samba prospect has been described by 
Wakefield (1978) as a porphyry-type deposit because of the presence of alteration zones, including 
a central sericitic core, as well as crackle-brecciation textures and the presence of chalcopyrite plus 
pyrite vein and disseminated mineralization (Fig. 16). The analysed sample is an epidotised biotite-
muscovite-K-feldspar-quartz 
schist, 
interpreted 
as 
a 
felsic 
metavolcanic 
rock. 
A 
cathodoluminescence image (Fig. 17) shows zircons with long axes < 200 µm. A striking feature of

these zircons is the presence of irregular, low-uranium overgrowths. These overgrowths could not, 
however, be dated with the SHRIMP as they are smaller than the beam diameter. They could well 
be hydrothermal or metamorphic in origin, but their origin is still enigmatic. They resemble 
overgrowths of xenotime on zircons found in other samples from the Zambian Copperbelt (M. 
Hitzman, pers. comm., 2003). Although a few of the zircons appear to be subrounded, the CL 
imagery shows that some of them are in fact euhedral zircons with the younger overgrowths. 
Sixteen analyses were performed on 16 zircons (Table 5, Fig. 18). All but three analyses plot in a 
cluster which yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1964 ± 12 Ma (MSWD = 1.8). This result 
is interpreted as the emplacement age of the metavolcanic rock. Analyses 12.1, 13.1 and 16.1 gave 
older 207Pb/206Pb ages (2160 ± 25 Ma, 2336 ± 9 Ma and 2423 ± 13 Ma respectively). These three 
zircons are interpreted as xenocrystic.

Granitoids and granitoid gneisses 
 
Mkushi Gneiss (sample MGn) 
 
First described by Bancroft and Pelletier (1929), Truter (1935) and Ackerman (1935, 1936), the 
banded to porphyroblastic biotitic granitoid Mkushi Gneiss was originally considered to be part of 
the Mkushi Group, comprising the Mkushi gneiss complex and some granites (Stillman,1965). De 
Waele and Mapani (2002) redefined the Mkushi Group as the “Mkushi Basement Complex” 
(MBC), which forms part of the basement to the southern Irumide Belt in central Zambia and 
includes granitoid gneisses and granites. Jackson (1932) first correlated granitic gneisses of the 
Nchanga area on the Copperbelt with the Mkushi Gneisses from the Mkushi area, as defined by 
Bancroft and Pelletier (1929).  
 
Field relations of the Mkushi Gneiss are complex and record several episodes of intrusion. The 
oldest intrusion is the biotite-bearing granite Mkushi Gneiss itself, which is strongly deformed and 
partly migmatitic. A second intrusive episode is represented by weakly deformed amphibolitic 
mafic dykes which cut across the foliation of the Mkushi Gneiss. Later undeformed aplite dykes, 
grading in places into pegmatites, are related to the Mtuga Granite and cut both the Mkushi Gneiss 
and the mafic dykes (Stillman, 1965; N’gambi et al., 1986). The Mtuga aplites are mineralised and 
contain chalcopyrite and pyrite associated with rutile and sphene, with minor local bornite and 
traces of molybdenite (Omenetto, 1973, 1974; Legg, 1976). It is these bodies that have been 
exploited at the Mkushi copper mines, in the Munshiwemba open pit and the Mtuga underground 
operation, both of which ceased operations in the 1970’s (Legg, 1976). Sample MGn comes from 
the typical Mkushi Gneiss exposed in the Munshiwemba open pit of the Mkushi copper mines (Fig. 
1 and 19). Twelve zircons were analysed (Table 6, Fig. 20). The analyses plot in a single cluster 
and yield a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2048.8 ± 5.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.85); excluding analysis 
2.1 which is the most reversely discordant. This result is interpreted as the age of emplacement for 
the protolith of the Mkushi Gneiss.

Mtuga Aplites (samples APL-1 and APL-2) 
 
Zircons from two mineralised Mtuga Aplites (Fig. 21) cutting the Mkushi Gneiss were analysed. 
These aplites occur as pink- and cream-coloured intrusions and are post-tectonic relative to the 
deformation and metamorphism that affected the host gneisses. Fourteen zircons from sample APL-
1 were analysed (Table 7, Fig. 22). Most of the zircons observed were distinctly zoned, comprising 
cores and thin rims that were too small to analyse. Ages for APL-1 were only obtained from cores, 
which show a range in 206Pb/207Pb ages from 2072 ± 9 Ma to 2009 ± 4 Ma. These cores are 
interpreted as xenocrystic. Nineteen cores and twelve rims of zircons from sample APL-2 were also  
analysed (Table 8, Fig. 23).  High–uranium zircon rims yielded a significantly younger 207Pb/206Pb 
age of 1059 ± 26 Ma (mean of 10 analyses) shown as an upper intercept in Figure 22. This age is 
interpreted  as  the  age  of intrusion  of  the  aplites.  They  are related  to the emplacement of other

Mufulira Pink Granite (sample MPG) 
 
Two distinct phases of granitoids are present in the vicinity of the Mufulira Mine (Brandt et al., 
1961). The western Mufulira Grey Granodiorite, which is the most abundant, is uniformly grey and 
is characterised by xenoliths of Lufubu schist (Brandt et al., 1961; Cahen et al., 1970c). This is a 
typical biotite granodiorite (also called a tonalite by Darnley, 1960) comprising epidote, 
plagioclase, quartz, biotite (sometimes altered to chlorite), scarce muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite 
and sphene. The pink granite comprises microcline, quartz, scarce plagiocase, and abundant 
muscovite (but no biotite or epidote) together with magnetite, rutile and haematite as accessory 
minerals. This granite lacks xenoliths of Lufubu schist. Ten zircons from the Mufulira Pink Granite 
were analysed (Table 9, Fig. 24). The analyses plot along a discordia with an upper intercept of 
1993.7 ± 7.1  Ma  (MSWD = 1.05),  interpreted  as  the emplacement age.  The discordant data may

reflect a Pb-loss of Pb during a Pan-African metamorphic event or during recent weathering. The 
ages of the Mufulira Lufubu schists (1968 Ma) and the Mufulira Pink Granite, together with the 
fact that the Mufulira Grey Granodiorite contains xenoliths of Lufubu schists, indicate that the pink 
and grey granites are two separate intrusions emplaced at significantly different times. The Grey 
Granodiorite may be c. 1945 Ma in age following model 1 of Cahen et al. (1970c; see above).

Chambishi Granite (sample NN75/1) 
 
Borehole NN75 is located in the Chambishi South-East prospect 13 km NE of drill hole BN53. The 
total depth of bore hole NN75 is 1033.78m, and our sample was collected from a depth of 
1030.31m, 14 m below the nonconformable contact between the basal Roan Group sediments of the 
Katanga Supergroup, and an underlying granite which we call the Chambishi Granite. Sample 
NN75/1 is a medium- to coarse-grained, weakly foliated biotite granite (Table 10, Fig. 25). Fifteen 
zircons from NN75/1 were analysed (Table 11, Fig. 26). The analyses plot in a single cluster, 
yielding a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1983 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 1.12). This result is 
interpreted as the emplacement age of the Chambishi Granite.

Mulungushi Bridge augen gneiss (sample MFG-1) 
 
Sample MFG-1 is a megacrystic augen orthogneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge c. 20 km N of 
Kabwe  (Figs. 1 and 27). It forms part of the basement to the Irumide Belt, and contains a strong 
foliation, defined by biotite, which trends NNE-SSW, parallel to the trend of the Irumide Belt. 
Twelve zircons from the augen gneiss were analysed (Table 12, Fig. 28). The analysed zircons 
form a cluster which yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1976.2 ± 4.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.87). 
There are three main possibilities for the origin for the zircons which have been analysed from this 
sample: magmatic, magmatic with a metamorphic overgrowth rim, and completely metamorphic.  
Since the ages of all zircons analysed plot in a cluster, the possibility that the zircons are of 
magmatic origin with a metamorphic rim may be dismissed. Other samples of intrusives described 
in this paper give a range of ages of 2050-1960 Ma, with none showing any metamorphic influence 
at this time. The ages obtained from sample MFG-1 plot well within this range.  The preferred 
interpretation of the age 1976 Ma is that it represents the emplacement of the Mulungushi Gneiss 
protolith

Roan Group tuff (sample Etoile 1) 
 
The Mine de l’Etoile du Congo or “Star of the Congo Mine” is located 12 Km NE of Lubumbashi 
(DRC). The deposit was inferred by Lefebvre and Cailteux (1975) to be hosted within a thrust slice 
of the Roan Group, but has been reinterpreted by Wendorff (2003) to occur within olistostromal 
megaclasts of former Roan Group rocks within the syntectonic Fungurume Group. There is no 
outcrop of the basement, which is buried under kilometres of tectonically-thickened Katangan 
rocks. Tuffs occur within the lower part of the Roan Group and more particularly within the beds of 
the Serie des Mines, known locally as the red RAT, SD and CMN (Machairas, 1974; Auger, 1975; 
Lefebvre and Cailteux, 1975). Sample Etoile 1 is a dolomitic carbonate rock with interbedded thin

Figure 28. Concordia plot of zircon analyses for the Mulungushi Bridge augen gneiss, sample 
MFG-1. 
 
graded layers (~ 1 mm thick) of primarily iron oxides and devitrified shards interpreted as volcanic 
tuff horizons (Fig. 29). The sample was collected to constraint the age of the volcanism but only 
three zircons were found, which yielded 207Pb/206Pb ages of 2831 ± 16 Ma, 2802 ± 36 and 1858 ± 
24 Ma (Table 13). These ages are older than the maximum age of deposition of the Katangan 
sequence (880 Ma) and the three analysed zircons are inferred to be xenocrystics.

DISCUSSION 
 
The basement to the Katangan Sequence in the Lufilian Arc is only exposed in the Zambian 
Copperbelt. The sequence thickens significantly towards the Katanga Province of the DRC 
(Demesmaeker et al., 1963), where it is largely allochthonous and has been transported northwards 
along well-defined nappe structures (Jackson et al., 2003). The nature of the basement over the 
entire 700 km extent of the Lufilian Arc can nevertheless be gauged using a combination of igneous 
crystallization and xenocrystic zircon ages. The following sections discuss the main features of the 
Palaeoproterozoic basement and attempt to place the new data from this study into a regional 
tectonic context. 
 
Magmatic activity 
 
Data obtained during this study shed light on the evolution of the Copperbelt basement. The 
petrography and geochemistry of the Lufubu schists, located in four different areas of the 
Copperbelt, complemented by analyses taken from the literature, reveal that the precursors of the 
Lufubu schists are mainly volcanic in origin. Compositions range from andesite, rhyodacite-dacite 
to trachyandesite and alkali basalt, and analyses plot in the calc-alkaline field on an AFM diagram. 
Samples of Lufubu schists from this study also demonstrate a wide range of textures and 
compositions. In contrast, rocks from the Muva sequence in the Copperbelt are exclusively 
sedimentary in origin (Garlick, 1961b). Chemical analyses from the host rocks of the Samba Cu 
prospect suggest that they are volcanic in origin, and U-Pb zircon geochronology shows these rocks 
are of Palaeoproterozoic age. They must therefore be reclassified as Lufubu schist metavolcanics, 
and are not part of the Muva Supergroup [as previously regarded by Garrard (1965, 1996) and 
Wakefield (1978)]. This study shows that the ages of the four samples of Lufubu schist from 
Chambishi (Zambia), Mufulira (Zambia), Samba (Zambia) and Kinsenda (DRC) span a period of 
~106 Ma (1980 ± 7 Ma, 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma, 1964 ± 12 Ma and 1873.5 ± 8.3 Ma respectively). 
Granitoids and granitoid gneisses, likewise, yield ages ranging from 2048.8 ± 5.8 Ma (Mkushi) to 
1976.2 ± 4.8 Ma (Mulungushi) with intermediate events evident at 1993.7 ± 7.1 Ma (Mufulira) and 
at 1983 ± 5 Ma (Chambishi). The Lufubu schists record episodicity in the magmatic activity. 
Furthermore, the ages of the Lufubu schists together with the granitoids show that this magmatic 
activity was long-lived, spanning nearly 200 My, and was represented by both intrusive and 
extrusive phases. This is best illustrated from the Chambishi basin where error bars on the ages of 
the Lufubu schists and the intrusive Chambishi Granite overlap. A plausible regional interpretation 
of these Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline terrains is that they were formed in a long-lived magmatic 
arc or series of arcs as a result of the subduction of oceanic lithosphere between 2.1 and 1.8 Ga. We 
suggest the name “Lufubu Metamorphic Complex” for this extensive, deformed and 
metamorphosed Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane in the Copperbelt basement.  
 
Links with other Palaeoproterozoic terranes in the vicinity of the Congo Craton, and regional 
tectonic history 
 
The Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Copperbelt basement, consisting of the Lufubu schist 
metavolcanics and associated plutonic granitoids, is continuous to the north with the Bangweulu 
Block (Ngoyi et al., 1991) (Figs. 1 and 19). The granitoids and metavolcanics in the Bangweulu 
Block range in age from 1869 ± 20 to 1695 ± 43 Ma (Brewer et al., 1979; Schandelmeier et al., 
1981, 1983; Kabengele et al., 1990; see above). This range encompasses part of the age range 
obtained from the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex in this study (2049–1874 Ma). If we include the 
1750 ± 50 Ma age of the Roan Antelope Granite (Cahen et al., 1970c; see above), then the younger 
limits of the age ranges from both areas are comparable, whereas the Lufubu Metamorphic 
Complex has ages as old as ~ 2050 Ma, ~ 180 My older than the oldest dated rocks from the 
Bangweulu Block. However, it should be noted that all ages from the Bangweulu Block are Rb-Sr

whole-rock isochrons, which may not reflect the intrusive ages, and instead may record a younger 
overprint or post-emplacement cooling. Such a situation is clearly exhibited by the Mkushi Gneiss, 
which has a U-Pb age of 2049 ± 6 Ma (this study), and a Rb-Sr whole-rock age of 1777 ± 89 Ma 
(Ng’ambi et al., 1986). The calc-alkaline magmatic rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex 
show certain petrographical and geochemical similarities to the granitoids and porphyritic 
metavolcanic rocks of the Luapula Porphyries of the Bangweulu Block in northern Zambia 
(Abraham, 1959; Thieme, 1970, 1971), and the Moba, Pepa-Lubumba and Lumono complexes of 
the Marungu Plateau, DRC (Tshimanga and Lubala, 1990; Kabengele et al., 1990, 1991). Minor 
quartzite and schist interbeds within the Marungu metavolcanics (Buttgenbach, 1905) may be the 
equivalents of similar metasedimentary rocks interbedded with the Lufubu metavolcanic rocks in 
the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex (e.g., Mendelsohn, 1961b). 
 
To the west of the Copperbelt, the pre-Katangan basement rocks are exposed in several inliers in 
the Domes area of NW Zambia (Thieme and Johnson, 1981). Very imprecise dating of basement 
gneisses from the Mwombezhi dome has shown that the protoliths had ages of c. 1700 Ma, but 
were overprinted at c. 1200 Ma during the Irumide Orogeny (Cosi et al., 1992). In the Kabompo 
Dome of NW Zambia, the major pre-Katangan lithologies are biotite gneisses, augen gneisses, 
migmatites, foliated granites, feldspar-phyric biotite granite, mica schists and pegmatites (Klinck, 
1977; Liyungu and Njamu, 2000). Feldspar-phyric granites from the Kabompo Dome have yielded 
SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages of 1940 ± 2.8 Ma and 1934 ± 6 Ma (Key et al., 2001). In the Kalumbila 
Co-Ni-Cu deposit, detrital zircons from the Katangan metasedimentary host rocks have yielded 
SHRIMP U-Pb ages between 2004 and 1884 Ma, interpreted to reflect derivation from the 
Palaeoproterozoic granitic gneisses exposed in the adjacent Kabompo Dome (Steven and 
Armstrong, 2003). In the Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia, near the borders with Angola and the 
DRC, Key et al. (2001) have obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2058 ± 7 Ma for a porphyritic 
granite. This age is within error of the age of the Mkushi Gneiss (2049 ± 6 Ma) obtained in this 
paper. The age range of the basement rocks in the Domes and Mwinilunga areas of NW Zambia, as 
well as their lithological make up, thus indicates a strong similarity with the rocks of the Kafue 
anticline in the Copperbelt area, and with the granites and gneisses of the Mkushi-Mulungushi area, 
which collectively belong to the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex. Recently a granitic gneiss near 
Kapiri Mposhi yielded a U-Pb zircon emplacement age of 2730 Ma (De Waele and Fitzsimons, 
2004). This gneiss, which is situated between the Kafue anticline and the Mulungushi Gneiss, is 
here interpreted as a sliver of an exotic terrane within the Palaeoproterozoic arcs of the Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex. 
 
Farther west and southwest of the Kabompo Dome and Mwinilunga areas of Zambia, the Katangan 
rocks and their basement are buried under Phanerozoic Karoo and Kalahari sand cover of the 
Kalahari basin (Money, 1972; Thieme and Johnson, 1981). Interpretations of regional gravity and 
airborne magnetic surveys of western Zambia have shown that the structural trends of the basement 
rocks of western Zambia strike NE-SW, along a southwesterly prolongation of the trend of the 
western part of the Lufilian Arc (Saviaro, 1978, 1979). Gravity maps of NW Botswana (Reeves, 
1978; McMullan et al., 1995) and airborne magnetic maps of Botswana and Namibia (Reeves, 
1979; Eberle et al., 1996) show the smooth continuation of the Lufilian geophysical trends of 
western Zambia into the Damaran Belt of NW Botswana and northern Namibia, with no significant 
breaks. This implies a continuity of the basement terranes between Zambia and Namibia. In 
northwestern Botswana, the Quangwadum augen gneiss, from a basement inlier west of the 
Okavango delta, was recently dated at ~ 2050 Ma with the U-Pb technique on single zircons 
(Singletary et al., 2003). Further west, in NE Namibia, in the Tsumkwe inlier close to the Botswana 
border, Hoal et al. (2000) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2022 ± 15 Ma from a fine-
grained granitic gneiss. This age is not only similar to that of the Quangwadum Gneiss, but is also 
comparable to the ages of the Mwinilunga porphyritic granite and the Mkushi Gneiss from Zambia. 
Also in the Tsumkwe area, Hoal et al. (2000) have obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 852 ±

11 Ma for a megacrystic granite. This date falls within the age range defined by the Nchanga 
Granite (877 ± 10; Armstrong et al., 1999, 2005) and the Lusaka Granite (842 ± 33 Ma; 
recalculated from the data of Barr et al., 1977).  
 
In northern Namibia, west of the Tsumkwe area, the pre-Damaran basement, consisting of various 
granitoids, the Huab Gneisses, and the volcanosedimentary Khoabendus Group, is exposed in the 
Grootfontein, Kamanjab and Huab inliers (Clifford et al., 1962; Frets, 1969; Guj, 1970; Porada, 
1974). Limited age dating in the Kamanjab inlier (also known as the Franzfontein inlier) has 
revealed the existence of a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane having ages between ~ 1987 Ma 
and ~ 1662 Ma (Burger et al., 1976; Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985). Recently, a rhyolitic quartz 
porphyry of the Khoabendus Group in the Kamanjab inlier, has been dated at 1862 ± 6 Ma (Steven 
and Armstrong, 2002). In NW Namibia, the granitic augen gneiss of Ruacuna was dated at 1795 
+33/-29 Ma with the U-Pb technique on multigrain zircon fractions (Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985). 
In the Central Zone of the Damara Belt, north of the suture with the Kalahari Craton, pre-Damaran 
basement of the southernmost Congo Craton is exposed in the Abbabis inlier and in various smaller 
gneissic exposures (Jacob et al., 1978). Zircon fractions from the basement gneisses have yielded 
U-Pb concordia upper-intercept ages of 1925 +330/-280 Ma and 1945 ± 18 Ma, from the Abbabis 
Inlier and the Tumas Dome, respectively (Jacob et al., 1978; Burger and Jacob, unpublished data, 
in Kröner et al., 1991). Tack et al. (2002) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2038 ± 5 Ma 
from augen gneiss in the Ida Dome, and they also found c. 2050 Ma xenocrystic zircon cores 
occurring in c. 542 Ma Damaran granitoids. In the Khan Gorge near the Rössing uranium mine, 
Kröner et al. (1991) found xenocrystic zircon grains with ages of 2014 ± 39 Ma and 2093 ± 51 Ma 
from c. 1038 Ma and 1102 Ma granitoid gneisses, respectively. These various studies indicate that 
the pre-Damara basement of the southern Congo Craton is mainly Palaeoproterozoic, together with 
some late Mesoproterozoic components (Kröner et al., 1991), which are similar to those from the 
Irumide Belt. The age range of the Palaeoproterozoic basement, between 2093 ± 51 Ma and 1925 
+330/-280 Ma, is similar to that of the basement inliers of northern Namibia and NW Botswana. As 
was pointed out by Master (1990, 1993), all these terrains may form a continuum with the Domes 
area of NW Zambia, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Central African Copperbelt 
basement, and the Bangweulu Block and define a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc along the S and 
SE margin of the Congo Craton. We refer to this magmatic arc as the Kamanjab–Bangweulu 
terrane. 
 
The NW-SE trending Ubendian Belt, which separates the Bangweulu Block from the Archaean 
Tanzanian Craton (2930–2530 Ma in age; Pinna et al., 1996, 1999), is an orogenic belt dated at 
between c. 2000 and 1850 Ma (Schandelmeier, 1983; Lenoir et al., 1994; Boven et al., 1999). It 
consists of strongly sheared amphibolite-facies quartzofeldspathic ortho- and paragneisses, 
amphibolites, anorthosites, and granitoids, with subvertical foliations, which are found in several 
discrete fault-bounded terranes (Daly, 1988; Ring et al., 1997). The Ubendian Belt may be the 
result of the collision of the Kamanjab-Bangweulu magmatic arc terrane, or at least the Bangweulu 
Block, and the Tanzanian Craton. This collision occurred between 2000 and 1900 Ma (Ring et al., 
1997), and resulted in a foliation in Bangweulu Block granitoids. This was followed by the 
intrusion of post-tectonic granites, which are dated at 1869 ± 20 Ma, 1838 ± 43 Ma and 1824 ± 75 
Ma (Schandelmeier, 1981, 1983). The sedimentary Mporokoso Group unconformably overlies 
these granitoids, hence there is possibly no connection between it and the Mpanshya River Group 
in the Irumide Belt (which was deposited at 1880 ± 12 Ma), even though they were correlated by 
Daly and Unrug (1982) and De Waele and Mapani (2002). After being sutured in the Ubendian 
Belt, the Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane and Tanzanian Craton formed a single unified 
minicontinent, the “Kambantan” terrane (named acronymically after its component parts), which 
eventually was accreted onto the Kasai-Angola Block to form the southeastern and southern part of 
the enlarged Congo Craton. The Ubendian Belt suffered major re-activation during later Irumide 
and Pan-African tectonism (Daly, 1986; Theunissen et al., 1992).

In Zambia and the DRC, the Bangweulu Block is separated from the Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic 
(2900–2200 Ma; Delhal and Ledent, 1973; Delhal et al., 1976; Bassot et al., 1981) Kasai-Angola 
Block by the Mesoproterozoic (c. 1400-1000 Ma) Kibaran Belt. The Kibaran Belt, which consists 
of a thick pile of quartzitic and pelitic metasedimentary rocks and gneisses, together with intrusive 
granitoids, records a cycle of sedimentation followed by magmatic intrusion, collisional 
deformation and metamorphism, and post-tectonic granitic intrusion (Cahen et al., 1984). Earlier 
notions of an intracontinental rift setting for the Kibaran Belt (Klerkx et al., 1987) have now been 
superceded by evidence supporting the operation of a full Wilson cycle, involving rifting, ocean 
opening and closure, followed by subduction and collision (Kampunzu et al., 1986; Rumvegeri, 
1989, 1991; Kokonyangi et al., 2002). Burke (2003) has shown that the Kabanga-Musongati Line 
of mafic-ultramafic complexes, that separates the Eastern External and the Western Internal 
Domains of the NE Kibaran Belt (Tack et al., 1994), likely represents the deeply eroded roots of an 
Andean-type magmatic arc. Whereas the NE Kibaran Belt of Rwanda and Burundi is over 200 km 
wide, it tapers wedge-like to the SW into the DRC, and then disappears completely in the 
Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia, where recent mapping by Key et al. (2001) has shown that only 
Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks are present, with numerous NE-SW trending ductile shears 
and brittle fractures being the only representatives of possible Kibaran structures in this area. 
Farther west, these structures, together with all other basement rocks, are obscured by sedimentary 
cover of the Kalahari Basin of eastern Angola, for which no subsurface geophysical or borehole 
information is available. However, the southwestern continuation of the Kibaran trends can be 
followed to SW Angola, where the basement rocks emerge again. Here there is evidence that the 
Palaeoproterozoic rocks that characterise much of the Precambrian of southern Angola (Bassot et 
al., 1981; Carvalho et al., 2000; McCourt et al., 2004), have been overprinted during the Kibaran 
Orogeny (Carvalho et al., 1987). The Cunene Anorthosite Complex, which is regarded as a 
Grenvillian-type massif anorthosite (Ashwal and Twist, 1994), has recently been assigned Kibaran 
ages of 1370 ± 4 Ma and 1385.0 ± 7.6 Ma (Morais et al., 2000; Mayer et al., 2000; McCourt et al., 
2004), based on zircon U-Pb ages of a crosscutting co-genetic mangerite dyke.  
 
Recent metamorphic and geochronological work in the Epupa Gneisses south of the Kunene 
Anorthosite Complex has revealed the existence of two orogenic events here- a Kibaran event at c. 
1.3 Ga (Seth et al., 2001), and an earlier event, in the Epembe granulites, at c. 1500 Ma, which has 
not been recorded before in Central Africa (Seth et al., 2003). A hint at the existence of a more 
widespread c. 1000 Ma event in Central Africa is given by the presence of xenocrystic zircons 
dated at c. 1500 Ma in a Katangan lapilli tuff in the DRC (Rainaud et al., 2003). The c. 1500 Ma 
“Epembe” event, which involved burial of post-1630 Ma metapelites to the lower crust followed by 
rapid exhumation (Brandt et al., 2003), was probably a short-lived event, being a record of a brief 
encounter between the southern Kasai-Angola Block and an unknown terrane, speculated by Seth et 
al. (2003), to be possibly one of the few c. 1500 Ma terranes known worldwide, i.e., Rondonia 
(Brazil), the Pinwarian (Grenville Province, Canada) or the Gothian (Baltic Shield, Sweden). The c. 
1500 Ma event was then followed by the Kibaran cycle, between 1400 and 1000 Ma, which is 
represented in this area by the Orue Gneisses, dated at 1334 ± 21 Ma, and red granites from 
southern Angola (1411–1302 Ma, Rb-Sr ages; Bassot et al., 1981; Seth et al., 2001, 2003). 
 
In order to explain the apparent southwestwards disappearance of the Kibaran Belt in NW Zambia, 
and its re-appearance in SW Angola and NW Nambia, we propose that the Kibaran Belt has been 
overthrust by the Kambantan minicontinent when this terrane collided with the Kasai-Angola Block 
during the Kibaran Orogeny. Hence the apparent southwestwards wedging out of the Kibaran Belt 
is explained by progressive overthrusting by the Kambantan terrane late in the Kibaran Orogeny. 
This model is illustrated schematically in Figure 30. Section A-A’ shows a section from the Kasai-
Angola Block to the Bangweulu Block, north of the Lufilian Arc. Here the Kibaran 
metasedimentary  rocks  (part  of  which  formed a  passive margin to the Kasai-Angola Block)  are

shown as a deformed belt between the Kasai-Angola Block and the Kambantan terrane. Forming 
the cover of the Kambantan terrane, is the Mporokoso Group, overlain by the tabular Katangan 
sequence. In Section B-B’, which runs parallel to the first section, but further south, passing 
through the Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia and the Lufilian Arc, the contact between the Kasai-
Angola Block and the Kambantan terrane is a major thrust (corresponding to the NE-SW trending 
ductile shear zones with down-dip lineations mapped by Key et al., 2001), which has over-ridden, 
at depth, the deformed Kibaran metasedimentary belt together with its intrusive granitoids. Forming 
a cover to the Kambantan terrane in this section are the Muva Group and the tectonically thickened 
pile of Katangan sediments. Also shown on this section is the 3200–3000 Ma Likasi terrane, which 
is a cryptic terrane whose existence was revealed by the presence of Mesoarchaean xenocrystic 
zircons in Katangan lapilli tuffs from the central Lufilian Arc (Rainaud et al., 2003). In the 
Mwinilunga area, Key and Armstrong (2000) showed that zircons from 2540 Ma granites of the 
Kasai-Angola Block contained xenocrystic cores with ages up to 3154 Ma, interpreted by Rainaud 
et al. (2003) as being derived from the underlying Likasi terrane. Our section shows the inferred 
contact between the 2800–2400 Ma high-grade (granulite facies) gneisses of the Kasai-Angola 
Block, and the Mesoarchaean Likasi cryptic terrane, which underlies the Neoarchaean (2540–2530 
Ma) granitic gneisses dated by Key et al. (2001), as well as the Kibaran Belt. The post-Muva, pre-
Katangan plutonism of the Nchanga Granite is also indicated on the section. A late Kibaran age for 
the major thrust underlying the Kambantan terrane is constrained by the presence of a population of 
xenocrystic Kibaran-aged zircons (1273 ± 46 to 1018 ± 27 Ma) located in the same pyroclastic 
layer from the Katangan sequence that contains the Mesoarchaean zircons from the Likasi terrane 
(Rainaud et al., 2003). If the thrusting of the Kambantan terrane over the Kibaran Belt occurred 
later, during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny (which post-dated the deposition of the Katanga 
Supergroup), then no Kibaran-aged xenocrystic zircons would have been present in the Katangan 
tuffs. 
 
Following the accretion of the Kambantan terrane onto the southern part of the Congo Craton 
during the Kibaran Orogeny, another series of terranes collided outboard of this, to produce the 
Irumide Belt, whose metamorphic peak was at c. 1050 to 1020 Ma (Schenk and Appel, 2001, 2002; 
De Waele et al., 2003). Irumide-aged gneisses (Kröner et al., 1991, see above) and metavolcanics 
(Steven et al., 2000) are also found in inliers of the southern Congo Craton within the central 
Damara Belt of Namibia and in NW Botswana (Kampunzu et al., 1998; Singletary et al., 2003), 

--- Page 43 ---

indicating that the Irumide Orogeny was more extensively developed on the southern margin of the 
Congo Craton. The Irumide terranes include supra-subduction zone magmatic rocks and small 
Archaean microcontinental slivers dated at c. 2600 Ma (Johnson and Rivers, 2004; Johnson et al., 
2004; Mapani et al., 2004). The lack of syn-collision-related granitoid magmatism, together with 
the high temperature-low pressure metamorphism, suggests that the Irumide Belt formed in an 
active Andean or Cordilleran type setting (Johnson and Rivers, 2004; Johnson et al., 2004). Many 
of these Irumide terranes in the southern part of the Congo Craton (north of the Mwembeshi 
dislocation zone) rifted away during the opening of the Khomas ocean at c. 750–730 Ma (Hoffman, 
1994), to form a rifted passive margin of the Congo Craton, in which Damaran and Katangan 
sediments were deposited.  
 
During the Pan-African Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, the Khomas ocean closed with subduction of 
oceanic lithosphere underneath the Congo Craton margin, leading to the formation of an Andean-
type magmatic arc, and ultimately to the Himalayan-type collision between the Congo and Kalahari 
Cratons at about 550–510 Ma (Miller, 1983; Porada and Berhorst, 2000).  Eclogites and talc-
kyanite whiteschists formed during the collision record extremely high pressures, compatible with a 
closure of an ocean at least 1000 km wide (John et al., 2003). Thus models for the formation of the 
Damara-Lufilian-Zambezi orogen due to the collision of the Congo and Kalahari Cratons (Burke et 
al., 1973) are being vindicated, at the expense of models which regard the Katangan-Damaran 
sequences as having formed in interlinked intracontinental rifts or narrow ocean basins (e.g., 
Hanson et al., 1994; Hanson, 2003). One of the reasons why Hanson (2003) supported the 
intracontinental rift model was the apparent continuity of the Irumide Belt into the Choma-Kalomo 
Belt, across the Neoproterozoic Zambezi Belt. Recent age dating has shown that the Irumide and 
Choma-Kalomo Belts have dissimilar ages, differing by up to 200 My, and that postulates of their 
former continuity are invalid (De Waele et al., 2003; Johnson and Rivers, 2004). Hence, earlier 
models which attempted to link the Palaeoproterozoic basement of the Central African Copperbelt 
with terranes that are now a part of the Kalahari Craton, (such as a magmatic arc extending to the 
Richtersveld region of southern Namibia,  with the Kheis and Magondi Belts being back-arc basins 
to this arc; Master, 1990, 1993), are now regarded as being invalid.  
 
In NW Namibia, the N-S trending Kaoko Belt marks the site of a transpressive collision between 
the Congo Craton and the Rio de la Plata Craton of South America (Dürr and Dingledey, 1996; 
Goscombe et al., 2003), and it may have preceded the closure of the Khomas sea in the NE-
trending Damara Belt (Prave, 1996). U-Pb zircon age dating has revealed the presence of 
Palaeoproterozoic (c. 1978-1933 Ma) basement rocks within this belt, as well as rocks which are as 
old as 2645–2585 Ma (Seth et al., 1998), and as young as 1530–1500 Ma (Kröner et al., 2002). The 
Archaean ages from this belt are regarded as coming from rocks that are part of an accreted exotic 
terrane that originated probably in the Rio de la Plata Craton and was left behind in Africa after the 
opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Palaeoproterozoic ages probably reflect the age of the 
Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane, which formed the basement as well as the foreland of the Kaoko 
Orogeny. 
 
Inherited zircons 
 
Five samples in our study showed signs of inheritance of older zircons. The sample LufMuf, a 
Lufubu schist from Mufulira, showed four zircon ages which are older than the 1968 ± 9 Ma 
emplacement age of the Lufubu schists. One zircon yielded a 207Pb/206Pb age of 2174 ± 13 Ma and 
the three remaining zircons yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057 ± 9 Ma. The oldest 
zircon reveals the presence of crustal components as old as 2170 Ma, while the three younger 
zircons have an age comparable to that of the Mkushi Gneiss, indicating that rocks of the age of the 
Mkushi Gneiss precursor were more widespread, and formed part of the source region, or were in 
the path of ascent of the magmas that produced the precursor volcanic rocks of the Lufubu schists.

The cores of zircons from the Mtuga Aplite sample APL-1, from the Mkushi Mine, yielded a range 
of 207Pb/206Pb ages between 2072 ± 9 Ma and 2009 ± 4 Ma. Zircons from Mtuga aplite sample 
APL-2 have inherited cores that range in age mainly from 2064 ± 15 to 1998 ± 18 Ma, with two 
older ages of 2730 ± 7 and 2688 ± 8 Ma. The age range of the zircon cores from the two aplites 
encompasses the age of the 2049 Ma Mkushi Gneiss, as well as the 2050–2020 Ma range of detrital 
zircon core ages from the Serenje paragneisses and migmatites north of Mkushi (De Waele and 
Mapani, 2002). Hence, the zircon cores from the Mtuga aplites are interpreted as being xenocrystic 
and may be inherited from a protolith similar to the Serenje Gneisses and migmatites, which 
underwent partial melting. Omenetto (1973, 1974) had argued earlier that the mineralized aplites 
from the Mkushi area were derived from “granitization”, regarded as the time as melting, of a 
sedimentary paragneiss precursor which contained disseminated Cu mineralization which was 
partitioned into the granitic melt.  
 
The two Neoarchaean zircon cores from APL-2, at 2730 ± 7 Ma and 2688 ± 8 Ma, are the only 
Archaean xenocrysts found in any of the basement granitoids. If, as argued above, the aplites are 
derived from partial melting of a metasedimentary paragneiss precursor, then the Archaean zircons 
would have to have been part of the detrital zircon population in the metasediment. The two 
Archaean zircon core ages are also similar to the ages of detrital monazites found in Irumide 
quartzites from the Irumi Hills (near Mkushi), and the Changwena Hill (SW of Serenje), which 
have respectively been dated at 2720 ± 24 Ma and 2720 ± 20 Ma (Snelling et al., 1964). The source 
of these Archaean detrital zircons and monazites is likely to be the newly discovered gneisses at 
Kampoya quarry, some 40 km northwest of Mkushi Mine, which have been dated at 2730 Ma (De 
Waele and Fitzsimons, 2004). The ages of detrital zircons and monazites in the Irumide Belt also 
correspond with the ages of detrital zircons found in the Muva quartzite south of Mufulira in the 
Copperbelt, which range from 1991 to 3180 Ma, including a cluster of ages between 2708 ± 18 and 
2463 ± 25 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2003). However, Mesoarchaean zircons dated between 3200 to 3000 
Ma, which are present in the Muva quartzites near Mufulira, are absent from the detrital population 
in quartzites and paragneisses in the Irumide Belt (De Waele and Fitzsimons, 2004), as well as in 
the xenocrystic zircon population in aplites derived by partial melting of the Irumide 
metasediments. This suggests that the detrital zircon populations in the Muva quartzites have a 
different origin from those in the Irumide quartzites and paragneisses. The Muva quartzites of the 
Copperbelt include detrital components from the Mesoarchaean Likasi terrane of the southern 
Congo Craton (Rainaud et al., 2003), and could only have been deposited after the amalgamation of 
the Kambantan terrane with the Congo Craton during the Kibaran Orogeny. Thus, despite 
containing no detrital zircons younger than 1941 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2003), the Muva in the 
Copperbelt may represent some kind of post-orogenic molasse deposit following the Kibaran 
Orogeny. 
 
Sample CT169/1256, from the Samba prospect, yielded three inherited zircons dated at 2423 ± 13, 
2336 ± 9 and 2160 ± 25 Ma respectively. The youngest of these xenocrystic zircons (2160 ± 25 
Ma) has an age similar to the oldest xenocryst from Mufulira, dated at 2174 ± 13 Ma, and is likely 
to be derived from a similar source. The two older xenocrysts from Samba indicate the presence of 
crustal components as old as 2420–2330 Ma in the source region, or in the path of ascent, of the 
magmas that produced the precursor volcanic rocks to the Samba Lufubu schists.  
 
Fine pyroclastic layers from the Neoproterozoic Katangan sequence (sample Etoile 1) yielded two 
Mesoarchaean zircons at 2831 ± 16 Ma and 2802 ± 36 Ma and one Palaeoproterozoic zircon at 
1858 ± 24 Ma. As is the case for Archaean zircons in tuffs from the overlying Mwashya Group, the 
two Archaean zircons from the Etoile 1 tuff sample may be derived from cryptic Archaean terranes 
which have been tectonically overridden by the Lufilian arc, such as the Likasi terrane, or other 
portions of the Congo Craton (Rainaud et al., 2003). Ages of c. 2800 Ma have been found in the 
southern exposed part of the Congo Craton in the Kasai region (Delhal et al., 1976). A xenocrystic 

--- Page 45 ---
 
41
zircon dated at 2839 ± 22 Ma was reported from a foliated Archaean granite in the Mwinilunga area 
of NW Zambia, which had an intrusive age of 2538 ± 10 Ma (Key et al., 2001). The third zircon, in 
the Etoile 1 sample, with an age of 1858 Ma, is clearly derived from the Palaeoproterozoic 
basement of the Copperbelt, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex.  
 
Inherited zircons from the Samba porphyry and Mufulira Lufubu schists may derive from cryptic 
terranes ranging in age from 2400 Ma to 2100 Ma. No rocks of such an age have yet been dated 
from the Copperbelt basement. Finally, no sample of the Lufubu schists or the Palaeoproterozoic 
granitoids has yielded xenocrystic zircons with Archaean ages. This suggests that the protoliths of 
the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex developed as juvenile crust far from older continental 
influences, in an oceanic island arc environment rather than in an Andean-type arc.  
 
Nd and Pb isotopic studies of Damaran metasedimentary and granitoid rocks by Hawkesworth et al. 
(1981) and Hawkesworth and Marlow (1983) indicate these rocks were derived from basement 
rocks up to 2000 Ma in age, and suggest an absence of any significantly older crust beneath the 
Damara Orogen. However, just as the detrital zircons from the Muva cover rocks of the Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex have much older ages, indicating partial derivation from an Archaean 
terrane (Rainaud et al., 2003), so also do detrital zircons from Damaran cover rocks have much 
older ages than their immediate basement. Jacob et al. (2000) have dated detrital zircons from the 
Damaran metasediments that host the Navachab gold deposit in the Karibib District, and have 
obtained SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 2872 ± 4 Ma, 2870 ± 6 Ma, 2428 ± 9 Ma, 2360 ± 5 Ma, and 1962 
± 10 Ma. The c. 2800–2400 Ga ages are similar to ages obtained from the Congo Craton in Kasai, 
DRC (Delhal and Ledent, 1973; Delhal et al., 1976), and they also encompass the age range of 
xenocrystic zircons from the Samba metavolcanics and the Katangan pyroclastics from the 
Copperbelt (see above). This may suggest that by the time the Neoproterozoic Katangan and 
Damaran sedimentation occurred, the Kambantan terrane had already been sutured to the Archaean 
Kasai-Angola Block, from which detrital components were shed into cover sequences on the 
younger terrane. Although no Archaean detrital zircons have yet been found in the Katanga 
Supergroup (Master et al., 2005), detrital platinoids in Katangan sediments at Mutoshi in the 
Kolwezi area have been inferred to be derived from the Archaean Kasai-Angola Block (Jedwab, 
1997). In these same Katangan sediments, Jedwab (1997) also reported detrital cassiterite grains 
which were probably derived from erosion of late Kibaran tin-granites. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The basement to the Katangan Supergroup in the Central African Copperbelt consists of the Lufubu 
schists and various granitoids and gneisses, which constitute the newly defined Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex. The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc-alkaline volcanic arc 
sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yield 
ages of 1980 ± 7, 1968 ± 9, 1964 ± 12 and 1874 ± 8 Ma. The Mkushi granitic gneiss from south-
east of the Zambian Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 ± 6 Ma. An augen gneiss, from the Mulungushi 
Bridge locality, yielded an emplacement age of 1976 ± 5 Ma. More evolved granitoids from the 
Copperbelt itself, the Mufulira Pink Granite and the Chambishi Granite, gave ages of 1994 ± 7 and 
1983 ± 5 Ma respectively. These gneisses, granitoids and acid-intermediate calc-alkaline 
metavolcanics are considered to represent stages in the evolution of a magmatic arc or several arcs 
that formed episodically over a 200 million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. The 
undeformed, copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut the foliation in the Mkushi 
gneisses, have xenocrystic cores similar in age to the gneisses, with overgrowths dated at 1059 ± 26 
Ma, regarded as the age of igneous emplacement of these aplites, which thus intruded during the 
Irumide Orogeny.

We interpret the rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex as belonging to a regionally extensive 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and 
the Marungu Plateau of the DRC, the Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane, which collided with the 
Archaean Tanzanian Craton during the c. 2000–1900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new 
composite minicontinental entity that we term the “Kambantan” terrane. The Kambantan terrane 
was accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the Mesoproterozoic c. 1400–
1000 Ma Kibaran Orogeny. The outboard side of the Kambantan terrane was the site of the c. 
1050–1020 Ma Irumide Orogeny, caused by the collision of several terranes with the Congo 
Craton. Part of the Irumide Belt subsequently rifted off at c. 750–730 Ma, leading to the formation 
of a rifted passive margin during sedimentation of the Damara and Katanga Supergroups, and the 
opening of an ocean basin which closed during the Pan-African Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, when 
the Congo and Kalahari Cratons were sutured together.

GEOCHRONOLOGY AND NATURE OF THE PALAEOPROTEROZOIC 
BASEMENT IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT (ZAMBIA AND THE 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO), WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
 
ABSTRACT 
 
U-Pb SHRIMP zircon age data, together with geochemical analyses, from the basement to the 
Katanga Supergroup in the Central African Copperbelt reveal the existence of a widespread 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane. The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc-
alkaline volcanic arc sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic 
of Congo (DRC), yield ages of 1980 ± 7, 1968 ± 9, 1964 ± 12 and 1874 ± 8 Ma. The oldest 
dated unit from the region, the Mkushi granitic gneiss from southeast of the Zambian 
Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 ± 6 Ma. The copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut 
the foliation in the Mkushi Gneisses, have mainly xenocrystic, zoned zircons with cores dated 
at c. 2070–2000 Ma. Overgrowths on these cores are dated at 1059 ± 26 Ma, which is 
interpreted as the intrusive age of the aplites. An augen gneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge 
locality yielded an emplacement age of 1976 ± 5 Ma. The Mufulira Pink Granite has an age of 
1994 ± 7 Ma, while the Chambishi Granite has been dated at 1983 ± 5 Ma, an age within error 
of Lufubu schist metavolcanics from elsewhere in the Chambishi basin. The gneisses, 
granitoids and acid-intermediate, calc-alkaline metavolcanics are considered to represent 
stages in the evolution of one or more magmatic arcs that formed episodically over a 200 
million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. We suggest naming this assemblage of rocks 
the “Lufubu Metamorphic Complex”. The rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex are 
interpreted to be part of a regionally extensive Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane 
stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and the DRC. This terrane is termed the 
Kamanjab-Bangweulu arc and is inferred to have collided with the Archaean Tanzanian 
Craton during the c. 2000–1900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new composite 
minicontinental entity that we term the “Kambantan” terrane. The Kambantan terrane was 
accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the c. 1400–1000 Ma Kibaran 
Orogeny.

GEOCHRONOLOGY AND NATURE OF THE PALAEOPROTEROZOIC BASEMENT IN 
THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT (ZAMBIA AND THE DEMOCRATIC 
REPUBLIC OF CONGO), WITH REGIONAL IMPLICATIONS 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Central African Copperbelt is a world-class stratabound Cu-Co metallogenic province, hosted 
by Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks of the Katanga Supergroup. It extends from the Zambian 
Copperbelt to the Congolese Copperbelt in the Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (DRC) (Robert, 1956; Mendelsohn, 1961a). Much of the age data relating to the Central 
African Copperbelt was produced in the period 1960-1980 using Rb-Sr and K-Ar techniques 
(Cahen et al., 1984). The existing data are generally imprecise and their interpretation 
controversial. In the mid-1990s a project was undertaken using the ion-microprobe U-Pb single 
zircon technique to provide more accurate time constraints on the Central African Copperbelt. In 
this study we present new data related to the basement of the Katangan and discuss their 
significance in terms of the evolution of the Central African Copperbelt. An accompanying paper 
(Master et al., 2005) presents additional constraints on the provenance ages of the Katanga 
Supergroup, while the ages of metamorphic events that have affected the Katangan metasediments 
are presented in Rainaud et al. (2005). 
 
REGIONAL GEOLOGICAL SETTING AND PREVIOUS GEOCHRONOLOGY 
 
The Katanga Supergroup was deformed during the Neoproterozoic to early Palaeozoic eras into an 
arcuate fold-thrust belt known as the Lufilian Arc. It unconformably overlies a fertile basement 
which has long been recognised as also containing widespread copper mineralization (Pienaar, 
1961; Wakefield, 1978). To the west, the Lufilian Arc is flanked by the c. 1400-1000 Ma Kibaran 
Belt, which separates it from the Neoarchaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks of the Kasai-Angola 
Block, which forms part of the larger Congo Craton (Cahen et al. 1984; Delhal, 1991; Tack et al., 
1999). To the southeast, the Lufilian Arc is flanked by the Mesoproterozoic Irumide Belt (Daly et 
al., 1984).  
 
Although the Central African Copperbelt extends through both the Democratic Republic of Congo 
and Zambia and has a strike length of 700 km in the Lufilian Arc (Figs. 1, 2), the pre-Katangan 
basement is mainly exposed in Zambia and immediately adjacent areas of the Democratic Republic 
of Congo (Brock, 1961; Demesmaeker et al., 1963). This fact, and other lithological and structural 
factors, led François (1974) to distinguish two provinces in the Central African Copperbelt: (1) the 
Zambian Province, extending from Zambia to the Congolese deposits close to the border (such as 
Musoshi and Kinsenda); and (2) the Congolese Province, extending from Lubumbashi to Kolwezi. 
Anticline (Garlick, 1961a). In adjacent areas of Katanga, basement exposures are found in the 
Konkola, Luina and Mokambo Domes (Gysin, 1933; Lecompte, 1933). About half of the pre-
Katangan basement consists of the Lufubu schists, and the rest consists mainly of a variety of 
supposedly intrusive granitoids (Gray, 1929; Mendelsohn, 1961b, c). Some of these granitoids were 
previously regarded as also being intrusive into the Katangan sequence, but this was disproven by 
Garlick  and Brummer (1951), who  showed that all  granites in the Copperbelt are of pre-Katangan  
age, and are unconformably overlain by Katangan rocks. Post-Katangan intrusive granitoids form 
several plutons in the western and southern exposed parts of the Lufilian Arc in Zambia (Thieme 
and  Johnson, 1981) and  in the Hook massif and  adjacent areas of the inner part of the Lufilian 
Arc. In the Zambian Province, the basement rocks are exposed in a structural high known as the 
Kafue (Hanson et al., 1993). The granitoids  intrusive  into  the Lufubu schists were first dated by     
Cahen et al. (1968,  1970 b,  c) using  bulk zircon  U-Pb  dating,  and  were  shown  to  represent  a

Palaeoproterozoic magmatic suite with imprecise ages spanning 2018–1702 Ma (Cahen et al., 
1984). Cahen et al. (1970c) dated the Grey Granodiorite at Mufulira using two near-concordant 
bulk zircon fractions. Depending on whether Pb-loss was assumed to be at zero age (model 1), or 
whether it occurred during the Kibaran Orogeny at c. 1300 Ma (model 2), they obtained model ages 
of 1945 Ma (model 1) to 2018 Ma (model 2) for the Mufulira Grey Granodiorite (Cahen et al., 
1984). The Roan Antelope Granite at Luanshya yielded a (recalculated) 207Pb/206Pb isochron age, 
based on four bulk zircon fractions, of 1702 Ma (Cahen et al., 1970c; 1984). Cliff and Clemmey 
(1976) obtained a Rb-Sr model age of c. 2000 Ma on muscovite from a pegmatite cutting basement 
rocks at Mindola Mine. A granitoid from the Luina Dome in the DRC, close to the Zambian 
Copperbelt, has been dated at 1882 +23/-19 Ma (Ngoyi et al., 1991). The Lufubu schists were 
constrained to be older than 2049 ± 103 Ma to 2198 ± 108, based on a model Rb-Sr age of a post-
Lufubu, pre-Katangan pegmatite, with assumed initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios in the range 0.705 to 0.710 
(Cahen et al., 1970a, 1984).  
 
The Palaeoproterozoic basement rocks of the Copperbelt extend northwards to the Luapula 
Province of Zambia and the Marungu Plateau of the DRC, southwest of Lake Tanganyika, where 
they constitute the basement of the Bangweulu Block (Drysdall et al., 1972; Brewer et al., 1979; 
Kabengele et al., 1990; Andersen and Unrug, 1984). Brewer et al. (1979) obtained Rb-Sr isochron 
ages of 1816 ± 22 Ma and 1833 ± 18 Ma, for a rhyolite and a granitoid from the western part of the 
Bangweulu Block. These rocks have relatively low initial 86Sr/86Sr ratios (Ri) of 0.70328 and 
0.70327,  respectively,  indicating  a  similar source  in  the  juvenile  crust  or  upper  mantle. In the

Marungu Plateau, three intrusive complexes have yielded whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron ages of 1863 
± 53 Ma, 1861 ± 28 Ma and 1695 ± 43 Ma, with Ri = 0.70277, 0.7026 and 0.70436 respectively 
(Kabengele et al., 1990). In northeast Zambia, granitoids of the Bangweulu Block have yielded 
whole-rock Rb-Sr isochron ages of 1869 ± 20 Ma, 1838 ± 43 Ma and 1824 ± 75 Ma 
(Schandelmeier, 1981, 1983).  
 
To the southeast of the Copperbelt, the Irumide Belt of northeast Zambia consists of quartzites and 
metapelites of the Manshya River Group, together with syntectonic to late-tectonic granitoid 
plutons, amphibolite-facies gneisses, and migmatites (Daly, 1986; Tembo et al., 2002; De Waele 
and Mapani, 2002). A metarhyolite interbedded with metasediments from the northern part of the 
belt in the Chinsali area has yielded a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 1880 ± 12 Ma, which gives the 
depositional age for the Manshya River Group (De Waele and Mapani, 2002). Syn- to late-tectonic 
intrusive granitoids in the Irumide Belt are dated at between 1046 ± 77 Ma and 953 ± 19 Ma, with a 
metamorphic peak at c. 1020 Ma (De Waele et al., 2003; SHRIMP U-Pb single zircon dates). 
Monazite growth at ultrahigh-temperature peak metamorphic conditions (T = 875°– 900°C; P ~ 6 
kb) took place at 1046 ± 3 Ma in garnet-cordierite gneisses in the eastern Irumide Belt near Chipata 
(Schenk and Appel, 2001, 2002). The basement to the Irumide Belt consists partly of granitoid 
gneisses referred to as the Mkushi Gneisses. These are intruded by the Mtuga granites and 
associated aplites (which are mineralized with Cu at the Mkushi Mine; Legg, 1976). The Mkushi 
Gneisses yielded a whole-rock Rb-Sr date of 1777 ± 89 Ma, while the Mtuga Granite yielded a date 
of 607 ± 39 Ma (N’gambi et al., 1986). A model Rb-Sr age of 1693 ± 50 Ma (assuming Ri = 0.709) 
was obtained for an aplite from Mkushi (Cahen and Snelling, 1966; recalculated by Cahen et al., 
1984).  Recent SHRIMP zircon dating by De Waele et al. (2003) of the Lukamfwa Hill granitic 
gneisses, between Mkushi and Serenje in the western part of the central Irumide Belt, yielded ages

between 1664 ± 9 Ma and 1639 ± 14 Ma. Other gneissic granites from the northern Irumide Belt 
have yielded zircon ages of 1592 ± 43 Ma and 1519 ± 19 Ma (De Waele et al., 2003).  
 
In the Copperbelt region, the Lufubu schists and the intrusive granitoids are unconformably 
overlain by quartzites and schists of the Muva Supergroup (Garlick, 1961b). The Muva 
metasediments have a maximum age of 1941 ± 40 Ma, which is the age of the youngest detrital 
zircon dated by Rainaud et al. (2003) from these sediments. The youngest pre-Katangan intrusive 
in the basement is the Nchanga Granite, with a SHRIMP zircon age of 877 ± 10 Ma, which gives 
the maximum age for Katangan sedimentation (Armstrong et al., 1999, 2005).  
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
Major element analyses were performed using X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry on a Philips 
spectrometer, in the Department of Geology, School of Geosciences, University of the 
Witwatersrand.  Major elements were determined using the fusion technique of Norrish and Hutton 
(1969). Trace element analyses were done on pressed powder pellets by XRF using the method of 
Feather and Willis (1976). 
 
The separation of zircons was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, Johannesburg, using 
conventional techniques. The separated zircons were examined and characterised in term of 
uranium contents using the cathodoluminescence technique. All zircons were randomly selected for 
analysis, but the locations of the analysed spots were chosen to avoid areas of anomalously high or 
low uranium contents. U-Pb analyses were performed on the Sensitive High Resolution Ion 
Microprobe (SHRIMP) I and II at the Australian National University, Canberra. The SHRIMP 
analytical procedure used in this study is similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. (1995). 
Age calculations and plotting of analytical data were carried out using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000) 
and all ages are quoted with errors at the 1σ level.  
 
RESULTS 
 
A total of eleven samples were dated for the purposes of this study, representing Lufubu schist 
metavolcanics (4 samples), and granitoids and granitoid gneisses (7 samples) from the basement to 
the Katanga Supergroup of the Central African Copperbelt and from an adjacent area in the Irumide 
Belt. Nine of these samples were collected in Zambia and two in the Democratic Republic of 
Congo (Figs. 1, 2). 
 
Lufubu schists 
 
Gray (1929) first differentiated highly deformed Lufubu schists and gneisses from overlying Muva 
metasedimentary rocks. Jackson (1932) called the Lufubu schists of the Nchanga area the 
“Basement Schist Series”, consisting of garnetiferous chlorite schists, quartz-mica schists and 
biotite gneisses, which he regarded as being metasedimentary in origin and Archaean in age. 
Mendelsohn (1961b) described the Lufubu schists as mica schists, quartzites and gneisses with 
minor metamorphosed carbonates, conglomerates, subgreywackes and arkoses, extensively 
intruded by granites. He regarded the majority of the Lufubu schists as metasediments with the 
possibility of some minor metavolcanics. Unconformably overlying the Lufubu schists are the 
Muva metasediments, which consist of deformed quartzites, metaconglomerates and metapelitic 
schists (Garlick, 1961b).

Geochemistry of the Lufubu schists 
 
Whole-rock geochemistry was undertaken on Lufubu schists from the Mwambashi B prospect in 
the Chambishi basin, Baluba Mine near Luanshya, the Kafue River south of Mufulira (Fig. 3) and 
from Kinsenda in the DRC. Samples were analysed for both major and trace elements (Table 1), 
and were examined petrographically for their mineralogical and textural characteristics. All 
samples present porphyritic textures with fine-grained matrices of metamorphic sericite. Lufubu 
schist compositions are presented in a Zr/TiO2 vs Nb/Y diagram (Winchester and Floyd, 1977) (Fig. 
4) which shows that these rocks plot in the andesite/ rhyodacite-dacite/ trachyandesite/ alkali basalt 
domain. The sample suite has characteristics consistent with a metavolcanic origin. The same 
analyses together with those from the host rocks of the Samba porphyry (Wakefield, 1978) are 
plotted in the AFM geochemical discrimination diagram of Irvine and Baragar (1971) (Fig. 5). All 
analyses show enrichments in the alkalis Na2O+K2O compared to FeO, and they plot in the calc-
alkaline field. Because these rocks may have suffered mobility of major elements during 
metamorphism, the AFM plot can only be used to suggest that the data are consistent with the 
Lufubu schists being mainly calc-alkaline metavolcanic rocks. The Lufubu schist metavolcanic 
rocks, together with subordinate metasedimentary rocks such as quartzites and marbles, are 
regarded as having formed in a subduction-related magmatic arc.  
 
Mufulira Lufubu schist (sample LufMuf) 
 
Sample LufMuf was collected from the Mufulira Mine, on the eastern flank of the Kafue anticline 
(Fig. 2). It is a blastoporphyritic metavolcanic derived from a hornblende-quartz porphyry in which 
the fine-grained matrix and amphibole-phenocrysts are replaced by intergrowths of epidote, biotite, 
chlorite, quartz magnetite and sphene (Fig. 6). Fourteen analyses were undertaken on 14 zircons 
from this sample. Cathodoluminescence images and plane-polarised photomicrographs (Fig. 7) 
show three types of zircons; euhedral, broken and abraded. All zircons exhibit an oscillatory zoning 
consistent with an igneous origin. The c-axes of the zircons are up to 200 µm in length. Euhedral 
zircons represent more than 50% of the entire population. Results of the analyses are reported in 
Table 2 and plotted on a concordia diagram in Figure 8. Two distinct populations and one older 
single zircon (zircon no. 8 on the CL image and in Table 2) are evident. The oldest zircon yields a 
207Pb/206Pb age of 2174 ± 13 Ma. The older of the two main populations includes three zircons 
(zircons no. 1, 5 and 11), all broken pieces, which yield a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057 ± 
9 Ma (MSWD = 1.8). It is unclear whether these zircons were broken during their incorporation as 
xenocrysts, or if they were broken during sample preparation. The youngest population consists of 
ten zircons (zircons no. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14 on the CL image and in Table 2) and 
yielded an average mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma with a MSWD = 1.6. On the CL 
image, these ten zircons are euhedral. An attempt at differentiating the three populations of zircons 
by plotting age versus Th/U ratio was made (Fig. 9). Th/U results from the youngest population 
(mean age at 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma) are scattered and vary between 0.36 and 2.18. The group of three 
broken zircons plots between 0.63 and 0.88. The oldest single zircon has the lowest Th/U ratio of 
0.34. Thus, there appears to be an inverse exponential trend between age and Th/U ratios; however, 
no definitive interpretation can be made, as the data set is not large enough. The age of the 
youngest population (1968 ± 9 Ma) is interpreted as the age of the protolith of the Lufubu 
metavolcanics at Mufulira. This interpretation is consistent with the igneous characteristics of the 
dated grains. The four older zircons are regarded as inherited. 
 
Kinsenda meta-trachyandesite (sample KNS1) 
 
Sample KNS1 was collected at Kinsenda Mine (DRC) on the southern flank of the Luina Dome 
near the border with Zambia (Figs. 2 and 10). It is a metatrachyandesitic porphyry with relic alkali-

feldspar phenocrysts showing perthitic texture (Fig. 11). Feldspar phenocrysts are quite deformed 
(some are kinked) and the matrix of biotite and muscovite shows two generations of metamorphic 
muscovite. Cathodoluminescence imaging shows that the zircons are large (Fig. 12), with the long 
axis ≥ 200 µm. All zircons exhibit an oscillatory zoning consistent with an igneous origin. Sixteen 
analyses were undertaken on 15 zircons (Table 3, Fig. 13). All analyses are concordant or less than 
15% discordant and plot in a single cluster. All the analyses yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb 
age of 1873.5 ± 8.3 Ma (MSWD = 1.7). This age is interpreted as the igneous age of the 
trachyandesitic protolith of the Lufubu schist at Kinsenda.

Chambishi meta-trachyandesite (sample BN53/1) 
 
Borehole BN53 is located in a prospect area called Mwambashi B, on the western flank of the 
Chambishi Basin (Fig. 2). The total depth of this drill hole is 693.43 m, and the sample was 
collected from a depth of 685.35 m, ~20 m below the contact with basal Katangan sediments. 
BN53/1 is interpreted as a trachyandesitic metavolcanic quartz porphyry with relict deformed 
quartz and plagioclase phenocrysts (Table 1), which was transformed into a blastoporphyritic 
biotite-sericite schist (Fig. 14). Ten zircons from BN53/1 were analysed (Table 4, Fig. 15). The 
analyses plot in a single cluster and their weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age is 1980 ± 7 Ma (MSWD = 
0.55). This result is interpreted as the igneous age of the protolith volcanic rock.

Samba felsic metavolcanic schist (sample CT169/1256) 
 
The Samba prospect is the largest copper deposit located in the basement of the Central African 
Copperbelt and consists of disseminations, stringers and veinlets of copper sulphides in quartz-
sericite schists derived from porphyritic igneous rocks of quartz monzonite to granodioritic 
composition (Wakefield, 1978). Ore resources have been estimated at fifty million tons with an 
overall grade of about 0.5% Cu (Wakefield, 1978). The Samba prospect has been described by 
Wakefield (1978) as a porphyry-type deposit because of the presence of alteration zones, including 
a central sericitic core, as well as crackle-brecciation textures and the presence of chalcopyrite plus 
pyrite vein and disseminated mineralization (Fig. 16). The analysed sample is an epidotised biotite-
muscovite-K-feldspar-quartz 
schist, 
interpreted 
as 
a 
felsic 
metavolcanic 
rock. 
A 
cathodoluminescence image (Fig. 17) shows zircons with long axes < 200 µm. A striking feature of 

--- Page 20 ---

these zircons is the presence of irregular, low-uranium overgrowths. These overgrowths could not, 
however, be dated with the SHRIMP as they are smaller than the beam diameter. They could well 
be hydrothermal or metamorphic in origin, but their origin is still enigmatic. They resemble 
overgrowths of xenotime on zircons found in other samples from the Zambian Copperbelt (M. 
Hitzman, pers. comm., 2003). Although a few of the zircons appear to be subrounded, the CL 
imagery shows that some of them are in fact euhedral zircons with the younger overgrowths. 
Sixteen analyses were performed on 16 zircons (Table 5, Fig. 18). All but three analyses plot in a 
cluster which yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1964 ± 12 Ma (MSWD = 1.8). This result 
is interpreted as the emplacement age of the metavolcanic rock. Analyses 12.1, 13.1 and 16.1 gave 
older 207Pb/206Pb ages (2160 ± 25 Ma, 2336 ± 9 Ma and 2423 ± 13 Ma respectively). These three 
zircons are interpreted as xenocrystic.

Granitoids and granitoid gneisses 
 
Mkushi Gneiss (sample MGn) 
 
First described by Bancroft and Pelletier (1929), Truter (1935) and Ackerman (1935, 1936), the 
banded to porphyroblastic biotitic granitoid Mkushi Gneiss was originally considered to be part of 
the Mkushi Group, comprising the Mkushi gneiss complex and some granites (Stillman,1965). De 
Waele and Mapani (2002) redefined the Mkushi Group as the “Mkushi Basement Complex” 
(MBC), which forms part of the basement to the southern Irumide Belt in central Zambia and 
includes granitoid gneisses and granites. Jackson (1932) first correlated granitic gneisses of the 
Nchanga area on the Copperbelt with the Mkushi Gneisses from the Mkushi area, as defined by 
Bancroft and Pelletier (1929).  
 
Field relations of the Mkushi Gneiss are complex and record several episodes of intrusion. The 
oldest intrusion is the biotite-bearing granite Mkushi Gneiss itself, which is strongly deformed and 
partly migmatitic. A second intrusive episode is represented by weakly deformed amphibolitic 
mafic dykes which cut across the foliation of the Mkushi Gneiss. Later undeformed aplite dykes, 
grading in places into pegmatites, are related to the Mtuga Granite and cut both the Mkushi Gneiss 
and the mafic dykes (Stillman, 1965; N’gambi et al., 1986). The Mtuga aplites are mineralised and 
contain chalcopyrite and pyrite associated with rutile and sphene, with minor local bornite and 
traces of molybdenite (Omenetto, 1973, 1974; Legg, 1976). It is these bodies that have been 
exploited at the Mkushi copper mines, in the Munshiwemba open pit and the Mtuga underground 
operation, both of which ceased operations in the 1970’s (Legg, 1976). Sample MGn comes from 
the typical Mkushi Gneiss exposed in the Munshiwemba open pit of the Mkushi copper mines (Fig. 
1 and 19). Twelve zircons were analysed (Table 6, Fig. 20). The analyses plot in a single cluster 
and yield a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2048.8 ± 5.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.85); excluding analysis 
2.1 which is the most reversely discordant. This result is interpreted as the age of emplacement for 
the protolith of the Mkushi Gneiss.

Mtuga Aplites (samples APL-1 and APL-2) 
 
Zircons from two mineralised Mtuga Aplites (Fig. 21) cutting the Mkushi Gneiss were analysed. 
These aplites occur as pink- and cream-coloured intrusions and are post-tectonic relative to the 
deformation and metamorphism that affected the host gneisses. Fourteen zircons from sample APL-
1 were analysed (Table 7, Fig. 22). Most of the zircons observed were distinctly zoned, comprising 
cores and thin rims that were too small to analyse. Ages for APL-1 were only obtained from cores, 
which show a range in 206Pb/207Pb ages from 2072 ± 9 Ma to 2009 ± 4 Ma. These cores are 
interpreted as xenocrystic. Nineteen cores and twelve rims of zircons from sample APL-2 were also  
analysed (Table 8, Fig. 23).  High–uranium zircon rims yielded a significantly younger 207Pb/206Pb 
age of 1059 ± 26 Ma (mean of 10 analyses) shown as an upper intercept in Figure 22. This age is 
interpreted  as  the  age  of intrusion  of  the  aplites.  They  are related  to the emplacement of other

Mufulira Pink Granite (sample MPG) 
 
Two distinct phases of granitoids are present in the vicinity of the Mufulira Mine (Brandt et al., 
1961). The western Mufulira Grey Granodiorite, which is the most abundant, is uniformly grey and 
is characterised by xenoliths of Lufubu schist (Brandt et al., 1961; Cahen et al., 1970c). This is a 
typical biotite granodiorite (also called a tonalite by Darnley, 1960) comprising epidote, 
plagioclase, quartz, biotite (sometimes altered to chlorite), scarce muscovite, magnetite, ilmenite 
and sphene. The pink granite comprises microcline, quartz, scarce plagiocase, and abundant 
muscovite (but no biotite or epidote) together with magnetite, rutile and haematite as accessory 
minerals. This granite lacks xenoliths of Lufubu schist. Ten zircons from the Mufulira Pink Granite 
were analysed (Table 9, Fig. 24). The analyses plot along a discordia with an upper intercept of 
1993.7 ± 7.1  Ma  (MSWD = 1.05),  interpreted  as  the emplacement age.  The discordant data may

reflect a Pb-loss of Pb during a Pan-African metamorphic event or during recent weathering. The 
ages of the Mufulira Lufubu schists (1968 Ma) and the Mufulira Pink Granite, together with the 
fact that the Mufulira Grey Granodiorite contains xenoliths of Lufubu schists, indicate that the pink 
and grey granites are two separate intrusions emplaced at significantly different times. The Grey 
Granodiorite may be c. 1945 Ma in age following model 1 of Cahen et al. (1970c; see above).

Chambishi Granite (sample NN75/1) 
 
Borehole NN75 is located in the Chambishi South-East prospect 13 km NE of drill hole BN53. The 
total depth of bore hole NN75 is 1033.78m, and our sample was collected from a depth of 
1030.31m, 14 m below the nonconformable contact between the basal Roan Group sediments of the 
Katanga Supergroup, and an underlying granite which we call the Chambishi Granite. Sample 
NN75/1 is a medium- to coarse-grained, weakly foliated biotite granite (Table 10, Fig. 25). Fifteen 
zircons from NN75/1 were analysed (Table 11, Fig. 26). The analyses plot in a single cluster, 
yielding a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1983 ± 5 Ma (MSWD = 1.12). This result is 
interpreted as the emplacement age of the Chambishi Granite.

Mulungushi Bridge augen gneiss (sample MFG-1) 
 
Sample MFG-1 is a megacrystic augen orthogneiss from the Mulungushi Bridge c. 20 km N of 
Kabwe  (Figs. 1 and 27). It forms part of the basement to the Irumide Belt, and contains a strong 
foliation, defined by biotite, which trends NNE-SSW, parallel to the trend of the Irumide Belt. 
Twelve zircons from the augen gneiss were analysed (Table 12, Fig. 28). The analysed zircons 
form a cluster which yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 1976.2 ± 4.8 Ma (MSWD = 0.87). 
There are three main possibilities for the origin for the zircons which have been analysed from this 
sample: magmatic, magmatic with a metamorphic overgrowth rim, and completely metamorphic.  
Since the ages of all zircons analysed plot in a cluster, the possibility that the zircons are of 
magmatic origin with a metamorphic rim may be dismissed. Other samples of intrusives described 
in this paper give a range of ages of 2050-1960 Ma, with none showing any metamorphic influence 
at this time. The ages obtained from sample MFG-1 plot well within this range.  The preferred 
interpretation of the age 1976 Ma is that it represents the emplacement of the Mulungushi Gneiss 
protolith

Roan Group tuff (sample Etoile 1) 
 
The Mine de l’Etoile du Congo or “Star of the Congo Mine” is located 12 Km NE of Lubumbashi 
(DRC). The deposit was inferred by Lefebvre and Cailteux (1975) to be hosted within a thrust slice 
of the Roan Group, but has been reinterpreted by Wendorff (2003) to occur within olistostromal 
megaclasts of former Roan Group rocks within the syntectonic Fungurume Group. There is no 
outcrop of the basement, which is buried under kilometres of tectonically-thickened Katangan 
rocks. Tuffs occur within the lower part of the Roan Group and more particularly within the beds of 
the Serie des Mines, known locally as the red RAT, SD and CMN (Machairas, 1974; Auger, 1975; 
Lefebvre and Cailteux, 1975). Sample Etoile 1 is a dolomitic carbonate rock with interbedded thin

sequence (880 Ma) and the three analysed zircons are inferred to be xenocrystics.

DISCUSSION 
 
The basement to the Katangan Sequence in the Lufilian Arc is only exposed in the Zambian 
Copperbelt. The sequence thickens significantly towards the Katanga Province of the DRC 
(Demesmaeker et al., 1963), where it is largely allochthonous and has been transported northwards 
along well-defined nappe structures (Jackson et al., 2003). The nature of the basement over the 
entire 700 km extent of the Lufilian Arc can nevertheless be gauged using a combination of igneous 
crystallization and xenocrystic zircon ages. The following sections discuss the main features of the 
Palaeoproterozoic basement and attempt to place the new data from this study into a regional 
tectonic context. 
 
Magmatic activity 
 
Data obtained during this study shed light on the evolution of the Copperbelt basement. The 
petrography and geochemistry of the Lufubu schists, located in four different areas of the 
Copperbelt, complemented by analyses taken from the literature, reveal that the precursors of the 
Lufubu schists are mainly volcanic in origin. Compositions range from andesite, rhyodacite-dacite 
to trachyandesite and alkali basalt, and analyses plot in the calc-alkaline field on an AFM diagram. 
Samples of Lufubu schists from this study also demonstrate a wide range of textures and 
compositions. In contrast, rocks from the Muva sequence in the Copperbelt are exclusively 
sedimentary in origin (Garlick, 1961b). Chemical analyses from the host rocks of the Samba Cu 
prospect suggest that they are volcanic in origin, and U-Pb zircon geochronology shows these rocks 
are of Palaeoproterozoic age. They must therefore be reclassified as Lufubu schist metavolcanics, 
and are not part of the Muva Supergroup [as previously regarded by Garrard (1965, 1996) and 
Wakefield (1978)]. This study shows that the ages of the four samples of Lufubu schist from 
Chambishi (Zambia), Mufulira (Zambia), Samba (Zambia) and Kinsenda (DRC) span a period of 
~106 Ma (1980 ± 7 Ma, 1968.1 ± 9.3 Ma, 1964 ± 12 Ma and 1873.5 ± 8.3 Ma respectively). 
Granitoids and granitoid gneisses, likewise, yield ages ranging from 2048.8 ± 5.8 Ma (Mkushi) to 
1976.2 ± 4.8 Ma (Mulungushi) with intermediate events evident at 1993.7 ± 7.1 Ma (Mufulira) and 
at 1983 ± 5 Ma (Chambishi). The Lufubu schists record episodicity in the magmatic activity. 
Furthermore, the ages of the Lufubu schists together with the granitoids show that this magmatic 
activity was long-lived, spanning nearly 200 My, and was represented by both intrusive and 
extrusive phases. This is best illustrated from the Chambishi basin where error bars on the ages of 
the Lufubu schists and the intrusive Chambishi Granite overlap. A plausible regional interpretation 
of these Palaeoproterozoic calc-alkaline terrains is that they were formed in a long-lived magmatic 
arc or series of arcs as a result of the subduction of oceanic lithosphere between 2.1 and 1.8 Ga. We 
suggest the name “Lufubu Metamorphic Complex” for this extensive, deformed and 
metamorphosed Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane in the Copperbelt basement.  
 
Links with other Palaeoproterozoic terranes in the vicinity of the Congo Craton, and regional 
tectonic history 
 
The Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Copperbelt basement, consisting of the Lufubu schist 
metavolcanics and associated plutonic granitoids, is continuous to the north with the Bangweulu 
Block (Ngoyi et al., 1991) (Figs. 1 and 19). The granitoids and metavolcanics in the Bangweulu 
Block range in age from 1869 ± 20 to 1695 ± 43 Ma (Brewer et al., 1979; Schandelmeier et al., 
1981, 1983; Kabengele et al., 1990; see above). This range encompasses part of the age range 
obtained from the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex in this study (2049–1874 Ma). If we include the 
1750 ± 50 Ma age of the Roan Antelope Granite (Cahen et al., 1970c; see above), then the younger 
limits of the age ranges from both areas are comparable, whereas the Lufubu Metamorphic 
Complex has ages as old as ~ 2050 Ma, ~ 180 My older than the oldest dated rocks from the 
Bangweulu Block. However, it should be noted that all ages from the Bangweulu Block are Rb-Sr

whole-rock isochrons, which may not reflect the intrusive ages, and instead may record a younger 
overprint or post-emplacement cooling. Such a situation is clearly exhibited by the Mkushi Gneiss, 
which has a U-Pb age of 2049 ± 6 Ma (this study), and a Rb-Sr whole-rock age of 1777 ± 89 Ma 
(Ng’ambi et al., 1986). The calc-alkaline magmatic rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex 
show certain petrographical and geochemical similarities to the granitoids and porphyritic 
metavolcanic rocks of the Luapula Porphyries of the Bangweulu Block in northern Zambia 
(Abraham, 1959; Thieme, 1970, 1971), and the Moba, Pepa-Lubumba and Lumono complexes of 
the Marungu Plateau, DRC (Tshimanga and Lubala, 1990; Kabengele et al., 1990, 1991). Minor 
quartzite and schist interbeds within the Marungu metavolcanics (Buttgenbach, 1905) may be the 
equivalents of similar metasedimentary rocks interbedded with the Lufubu metavolcanic rocks in 
the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex (e.g., Mendelsohn, 1961b). 
 
To the west of the Copperbelt, the pre-Katangan basement rocks are exposed in several inliers in 
the Domes area of NW Zambia (Thieme and Johnson, 1981). Very imprecise dating of basement 
gneisses from the Mwombezhi dome has shown that the protoliths had ages of c. 1700 Ma, but 
were overprinted at c. 1200 Ma during the Irumide Orogeny (Cosi et al., 1992). In the Kabompo 
Dome of NW Zambia, the major pre-Katangan lithologies are biotite gneisses, augen gneisses, 
migmatites, foliated granites, feldspar-phyric biotite granite, mica schists and pegmatites (Klinck, 
1977; Liyungu and Njamu, 2000). Feldspar-phyric granites from the Kabompo Dome have yielded 
SHRIMP zircon U-Pb ages of 1940 ± 2.8 Ma and 1934 ± 6 Ma (Key et al., 2001). In the Kalumbila 
Co-Ni-Cu deposit, detrital zircons from the Katangan metasedimentary host rocks have yielded 
SHRIMP U-Pb ages between 2004 and 1884 Ma, interpreted to reflect derivation from the 
Palaeoproterozoic granitic gneisses exposed in the adjacent Kabompo Dome (Steven and 
Armstrong, 2003). In the Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia, near the borders with Angola and the 
DRC, Key et al. (2001) have obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2058 ± 7 Ma for a porphyritic 
granite. This age is within error of the age of the Mkushi Gneiss (2049 ± 6 Ma) obtained in this 
paper. The age range of the basement rocks in the Domes and Mwinilunga areas of NW Zambia, as 
well as their lithological make up, thus indicates a strong similarity with the rocks of the Kafue 
anticline in the Copperbelt area, and with the granites and gneisses of the Mkushi-Mulungushi area, 
which collectively belong to the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex. Recently a granitic gneiss near 
Kapiri Mposhi yielded a U-Pb zircon emplacement age of 2730 Ma (De Waele and Fitzsimons, 
2004). This gneiss, which is situated between the Kafue anticline and the Mulungushi Gneiss, is 
here interpreted as a sliver of an exotic terrane within the Palaeoproterozoic arcs of the Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex. 
 
Farther west and southwest of the Kabompo Dome and Mwinilunga areas of Zambia, the Katangan 
rocks and their basement are buried under Phanerozoic Karoo and Kalahari sand cover of the 
Kalahari basin (Money, 1972; Thieme and Johnson, 1981). Interpretations of regional gravity and 
airborne magnetic surveys of western Zambia have shown that the structural trends of the basement 
rocks of western Zambia strike NE-SW, along a southwesterly prolongation of the trend of the 
western part of the Lufilian Arc (Saviaro, 1978, 1979). Gravity maps of NW Botswana (Reeves, 
1978; McMullan et al., 1995) and airborne magnetic maps of Botswana and Namibia (Reeves, 
1979; Eberle et al., 1996) show the smooth continuation of the Lufilian geophysical trends of 
western Zambia into the Damaran Belt of NW Botswana and northern Namibia, with no significant 
breaks. This implies a continuity of the basement terranes between Zambia and Namibia. In 
northwestern Botswana, the Quangwadum augen gneiss, from a basement inlier west of the 
Okavango delta, was recently dated at ~ 2050 Ma with the U-Pb technique on single zircons 
(Singletary et al., 2003). Further west, in NE Namibia, in the Tsumkwe inlier close to the Botswana 
border, Hoal et al. (2000) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2022 ± 15 Ma from a fine-
grained granitic gneiss. This age is not only similar to that of the Quangwadum Gneiss, but is also 
comparable to the ages of the Mwinilunga porphyritic granite and the Mkushi Gneiss from Zambia. 
Also in the Tsumkwe area, Hoal et al. (2000) have obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 852 ±

11 Ma for a megacrystic granite. This date falls within the age range defined by the Nchanga 
Granite (877 ± 10; Armstrong et al., 1999, 2005) and the Lusaka Granite (842 ± 33 Ma; 
recalculated from the data of Barr et al., 1977).  
 
In northern Namibia, west of the Tsumkwe area, the pre-Damaran basement, consisting of various 
granitoids, the Huab Gneisses, and the volcanosedimentary Khoabendus Group, is exposed in the 
Grootfontein, Kamanjab and Huab inliers (Clifford et al., 1962; Frets, 1969; Guj, 1970; Porada, 
1974). Limited age dating in the Kamanjab inlier (also known as the Franzfontein inlier) has 
revealed the existence of a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane having ages between ~ 1987 Ma 
and ~ 1662 Ma (Burger et al., 1976; Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985). Recently, a rhyolitic quartz 
porphyry of the Khoabendus Group in the Kamanjab inlier, has been dated at 1862 ± 6 Ma (Steven 
and Armstrong, 2002). In NW Namibia, the granitic augen gneiss of Ruacuna was dated at 1795 
+33/-29 Ma with the U-Pb technique on multigrain zircon fractions (Tegtmeyer and Kröner, 1985). 
In the Central Zone of the Damara Belt, north of the suture with the Kalahari Craton, pre-Damaran 
basement of the southernmost Congo Craton is exposed in the Abbabis inlier and in various smaller 
gneissic exposures (Jacob et al., 1978). Zircon fractions from the basement gneisses have yielded 
U-Pb concordia upper-intercept ages of 1925 +330/-280 Ma and 1945 ± 18 Ma, from the Abbabis 
Inlier and the Tumas Dome, respectively (Jacob et al., 1978; Burger and Jacob, unpublished data, 
in Kröner et al., 1991). Tack et al. (2002) obtained a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon age of 2038 ± 5 Ma 
from augen gneiss in the Ida Dome, and they also found c. 2050 Ma xenocrystic zircon cores 
occurring in c. 542 Ma Damaran granitoids. In the Khan Gorge near the Rössing uranium mine, 
Kröner et al. (1991) found xenocrystic zircon grains with ages of 2014 ± 39 Ma and 2093 ± 51 Ma 
from c. 1038 Ma and 1102 Ma granitoid gneisses, respectively. These various studies indicate that 
the pre-Damara basement of the southern Congo Craton is mainly Palaeoproterozoic, together with 
some late Mesoproterozoic components (Kröner et al., 1991), which are similar to those from the 
Irumide Belt. The age range of the Palaeoproterozoic basement, between 2093 ± 51 Ma and 1925 
+330/-280 Ma, is similar to that of the basement inliers of northern Namibia and NW Botswana. As 
was pointed out by Master (1990, 1993), all these terrains may form a continuum with the Domes 
area of NW Zambia, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex of the Central African Copperbelt 
basement, and the Bangweulu Block and define a Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc along the S and 
SE margin of the Congo Craton. We refer to this magmatic arc as the Kamanjab–Bangweulu 
terrane. 
 
The NW-SE trending Ubendian Belt, which separates the Bangweulu Block from the Archaean 
Tanzanian Craton (2930–2530 Ma in age; Pinna et al., 1996, 1999), is an orogenic belt dated at 
between c. 2000 and 1850 Ma (Schandelmeier, 1983; Lenoir et al., 1994; Boven et al., 1999). It 
consists of strongly sheared amphibolite-facies quartzofeldspathic ortho- and paragneisses, 
amphibolites, anorthosites, and granitoids, with subvertical foliations, which are found in several 
discrete fault-bounded terranes (Daly, 1988; Ring et al., 1997). The Ubendian Belt may be the 
result of the collision of the Kamanjab-Bangweulu magmatic arc terrane, or at least the Bangweulu 
Block, and the Tanzanian Craton. This collision occurred between 2000 and 1900 Ma (Ring et al., 
1997), and resulted in a foliation in Bangweulu Block granitoids. This was followed by the 
intrusion of post-tectonic granites, which are dated at 1869 ± 20 Ma, 1838 ± 43 Ma and 1824 ± 75 
Ma (Schandelmeier, 1981, 1983). The sedimentary Mporokoso Group unconformably overlies 
these granitoids, hence there is possibly no connection between it and the Mpanshya River Group 
in the Irumide Belt (which was deposited at 1880 ± 12 Ma), even though they were correlated by 
Daly and Unrug (1982) and De Waele and Mapani (2002). After being sutured in the Ubendian 
Belt, the Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane and Tanzanian Craton formed a single unified 
minicontinent, the “Kambantan” terrane (named acronymically after its component parts), which 
eventually was accreted onto the Kasai-Angola Block to form the southeastern and southern part of 
the enlarged Congo Craton. The Ubendian Belt suffered major re-activation during later Irumide 
and Pan-African tectonism (Daly, 1986; Theunissen et al., 1992).

In Zambia and the DRC, the Bangweulu Block is separated from the Archaean to Palaeoproterozoic 
(2900–2200 Ma; Delhal and Ledent, 1973; Delhal et al., 1976; Bassot et al., 1981) Kasai-Angola 
Block by the Mesoproterozoic (c. 1400-1000 Ma) Kibaran Belt. The Kibaran Belt, which consists 
of a thick pile of quartzitic and pelitic metasedimentary rocks and gneisses, together with intrusive 
granitoids, records a cycle of sedimentation followed by magmatic intrusion, collisional 
deformation and metamorphism, and post-tectonic granitic intrusion (Cahen et al., 1984). Earlier 
notions of an intracontinental rift setting for the Kibaran Belt (Klerkx et al., 1987) have now been 
superceded by evidence supporting the operation of a full Wilson cycle, involving rifting, ocean 
opening and closure, followed by subduction and collision (Kampunzu et al., 1986; Rumvegeri, 
1989, 1991; Kokonyangi et al., 2002). Burke (2003) has shown that the Kabanga-Musongati Line 
of mafic-ultramafic complexes, that separates the Eastern External and the Western Internal 
Domains of the NE Kibaran Belt (Tack et al., 1994), likely represents the deeply eroded roots of an 
Andean-type magmatic arc. Whereas the NE Kibaran Belt of Rwanda and Burundi is over 200 km 
wide, it tapers wedge-like to the SW into the DRC, and then disappears completely in the 
Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia, where recent mapping by Key et al. (2001) has shown that only 
Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic rocks are present, with numerous NE-SW trending ductile shears 
and brittle fractures being the only representatives of possible Kibaran structures in this area. 
Farther west, these structures, together with all other basement rocks, are obscured by sedimentary 
cover of the Kalahari Basin of eastern Angola, for which no subsurface geophysical or borehole 
information is available. However, the southwestern continuation of the Kibaran trends can be 
followed to SW Angola, where the basement rocks emerge again. Here there is evidence that the 
Palaeoproterozoic rocks that characterise much of the Precambrian of southern Angola (Bassot et 
al., 1981; Carvalho et al., 2000; McCourt et al., 2004), have been overprinted during the Kibaran 
Orogeny (Carvalho et al., 1987). The Cunene Anorthosite Complex, which is regarded as a 
Grenvillian-type massif anorthosite (Ashwal and Twist, 1994), has recently been assigned Kibaran 
ages of 1370 ± 4 Ma and 1385.0 ± 7.6 Ma (Morais et al., 2000; Mayer et al., 2000; McCourt et al., 
2004), based on zircon U-Pb ages of a crosscutting co-genetic mangerite dyke.  
 
Recent metamorphic and geochronological work in the Epupa Gneisses south of the Kunene 
Anorthosite Complex has revealed the existence of two orogenic events here- a Kibaran event at c. 
1.3 Ga (Seth et al., 2001), and an earlier event, in the Epembe granulites, at c. 1500 Ma, which has 
not been recorded before in Central Africa (Seth et al., 2003). A hint at the existence of a more 
widespread c. 1000 Ma event in Central Africa is given by the presence of xenocrystic zircons 
dated at c. 1500 Ma in a Katangan lapilli tuff in the DRC (Rainaud et al., 2003). The c. 1500 Ma 
“Epembe” event, which involved burial of post-1630 Ma metapelites to the lower crust followed by 
rapid exhumation (Brandt et al., 2003), was probably a short-lived event, being a record of a brief 
encounter between the southern Kasai-Angola Block and an unknown terrane, speculated by Seth et 
al. (2003), to be possibly one of the few c. 1500 Ma terranes known worldwide, i.e., Rondonia 
(Brazil), the Pinwarian (Grenville Province, Canada) or the Gothian (Baltic Shield, Sweden). The c. 
1500 Ma event was then followed by the Kibaran cycle, between 1400 and 1000 Ma, which is 
represented in this area by the Orue Gneisses, dated at 1334 ± 21 Ma, and red granites from 
southern Angola (1411–1302 Ma, Rb-Sr ages; Bassot et al., 1981; Seth et al., 2001, 2003). 
 
In order to explain the apparent southwestwards disappearance of the Kibaran Belt in NW Zambia, 
and its re-appearance in SW Angola and NW Nambia, we propose that the Kibaran Belt has been 
overthrust by the Kambantan minicontinent when this terrane collided with the Kasai-Angola Block 
during the Kibaran Orogeny. Hence the apparent southwestwards wedging out of the Kibaran Belt 
is explained by progressive overthrusting by the Kambantan terrane late in the Kibaran Orogeny. 
This model is illustrated schematically in Figure 30. Section A-A’ shows a section from the Kasai-
Angola Block to the Bangweulu Block, north of the Lufilian Arc. Here the Kibaran 
metasedimentary  rocks  (part  of  which  formed a  passive margin to the Kasai-Angola Block)  are

shown as a deformed belt between the Kasai-Angola Block and the Kambantan terrane. Forming 
the cover of the Kambantan terrane, is the Mporokoso Group, overlain by the tabular Katangan 
sequence. In Section B-B’, which runs parallel to the first section, but further south, passing 
through the Mwinilunga area of NW Zambia and the Lufilian Arc, the contact between the Kasai-
Angola Block and the Kambantan terrane is a major thrust (corresponding to the NE-SW trending 
ductile shear zones with down-dip lineations mapped by Key et al., 2001), which has over-ridden, 
at depth, the deformed Kibaran metasedimentary belt together with its intrusive granitoids. Forming 
a cover to the Kambantan terrane in this section are the Muva Group and the tectonically thickened 
pile of Katangan sediments. Also shown on this section is the 3200–3000 Ma Likasi terrane, which 
is a cryptic terrane whose existence was revealed by the presence of Mesoarchaean xenocrystic 
zircons in Katangan lapilli tuffs from the central Lufilian Arc (Rainaud et al., 2003). In the 
Mwinilunga area, Key and Armstrong (2000) showed that zircons from 2540 Ma granites of the 
Kasai-Angola Block contained xenocrystic cores with ages up to 3154 Ma, interpreted by Rainaud 
et al. (2003) as being derived from the underlying Likasi terrane. Our section shows the inferred 
contact between the 2800–2400 Ma high-grade (granulite facies) gneisses of the Kasai-Angola 
Block, and the Mesoarchaean Likasi cryptic terrane, which underlies the Neoarchaean (2540–2530 
Ma) granitic gneisses dated by Key et al. (2001), as well as the Kibaran Belt. The post-Muva, pre-
Katangan plutonism of the Nchanga Granite is also indicated on the section. A late Kibaran age for 
the major thrust underlying the Kambantan terrane is constrained by the presence of a population of 
xenocrystic Kibaran-aged zircons (1273 ± 46 to 1018 ± 27 Ma) located in the same pyroclastic 
layer from the Katangan sequence that contains the Mesoarchaean zircons from the Likasi terrane 
(Rainaud et al., 2003). If the thrusting of the Kambantan terrane over the Kibaran Belt occurred 
later, during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny (which post-dated the deposition of the Katanga 
Supergroup), then no Kibaran-aged xenocrystic zircons would have been present in the Katangan 
tuffs. 
 
Following the accretion of the Kambantan terrane onto the southern part of the Congo Craton 
during the Kibaran Orogeny, another series of terranes collided outboard of this, to produce the 
Irumide Belt, whose metamorphic peak was at c. 1050 to 1020 Ma (Schenk and Appel, 2001, 2002; 
De Waele et al., 2003). Irumide-aged gneisses (Kröner et al., 1991, see above) and metavolcanics 
(Steven et al., 2000) are also found in inliers of the southern Congo Craton within the central 
Damara Belt of Namibia and in NW Botswana (Kampunzu et al., 1998; Singletary et al., 2003),

indicating that the Irumide Orogeny was more extensively developed on the southern margin of the 
Congo Craton. The Irumide terranes include supra-subduction zone magmatic rocks and small 
Archaean microcontinental slivers dated at c. 2600 Ma (Johnson and Rivers, 2004; Johnson et al., 
2004; Mapani et al., 2004). The lack of syn-collision-related granitoid magmatism, together with 
the high temperature-low pressure metamorphism, suggests that the Irumide Belt formed in an 
active Andean or Cordilleran type setting (Johnson and Rivers, 2004; Johnson et al., 2004). Many 
of these Irumide terranes in the southern part of the Congo Craton (north of the Mwembeshi 
dislocation zone) rifted away during the opening of the Khomas ocean at c. 750–730 Ma (Hoffman, 
1994), to form a rifted passive margin of the Congo Craton, in which Damaran and Katangan 
sediments were deposited.  
 
During the Pan-African Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, the Khomas ocean closed with subduction of 
oceanic lithosphere underneath the Congo Craton margin, leading to the formation of an Andean-
type magmatic arc, and ultimately to the Himalayan-type collision between the Congo and Kalahari 
Cratons at about 550–510 Ma (Miller, 1983; Porada and Berhorst, 2000).  Eclogites and talc-
kyanite whiteschists formed during the collision record extremely high pressures, compatible with a 
closure of an ocean at least 1000 km wide (John et al., 2003). Thus models for the formation of the 
Damara-Lufilian-Zambezi orogen due to the collision of the Congo and Kalahari Cratons (Burke et 
al., 1973) are being vindicated, at the expense of models which regard the Katangan-Damaran 
sequences as having formed in interlinked intracontinental rifts or narrow ocean basins (e.g., 
Hanson et al., 1994; Hanson, 2003). One of the reasons why Hanson (2003) supported the 
intracontinental rift model was the apparent continuity of the Irumide Belt into the Choma-Kalomo 
Belt, across the Neoproterozoic Zambezi Belt. Recent age dating has shown that the Irumide and 
Choma-Kalomo Belts have dissimilar ages, differing by up to 200 My, and that postulates of their 
former continuity are invalid (De Waele et al., 2003; Johnson and Rivers, 2004). Hence, earlier 
models which attempted to link the Palaeoproterozoic basement of the Central African Copperbelt 
with terranes that are now a part of the Kalahari Craton, (such as a magmatic arc extending to the 
Richtersveld region of southern Namibia,  with the Kheis and Magondi Belts being back-arc basins 
to this arc; Master, 1990, 1993), are now regarded as being invalid.  
 
In NW Namibia, the N-S trending Kaoko Belt marks the site of a transpressive collision between 
the Congo Craton and the Rio de la Plata Craton of South America (Dürr and Dingledey, 1996; 
Goscombe et al., 2003), and it may have preceded the closure of the Khomas sea in the NE-
trending Damara Belt (Prave, 1996). U-Pb zircon age dating has revealed the presence of 
Palaeoproterozoic (c. 1978-1933 Ma) basement rocks within this belt, as well as rocks which are as 
old as 2645–2585 Ma (Seth et al., 1998), and as young as 1530–1500 Ma (Kröner et al., 2002). The 
Archaean ages from this belt are regarded as coming from rocks that are part of an accreted exotic 
terrane that originated probably in the Rio de la Plata Craton and was left behind in Africa after the 
opening of the Atlantic Ocean. The Palaeoproterozoic ages probably reflect the age of the 
Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane, which formed the basement as well as the foreland of the Kaoko 
Orogeny. 
 
Inherited zircons 
 
Five samples in our study showed signs of inheritance of older zircons. The sample LufMuf, a 
Lufubu schist from Mufulira, showed four zircon ages which are older than the 1968 ± 9 Ma 
emplacement age of the Lufubu schists. One zircon yielded a 207Pb/206Pb age of 2174 ± 13 Ma and 
the three remaining zircons yielded a weighted mean 207Pb/206Pb age of 2057 ± 9 Ma. The oldest 
zircon reveals the presence of crustal components as old as 2170 Ma, while the three younger 
zircons have an age comparable to that of the Mkushi Gneiss, indicating that rocks of the age of the 
Mkushi Gneiss precursor were more widespread, and formed part of the source region, or were in 
the path of ascent of the magmas that produced the precursor volcanic rocks of the Lufubu schists.  

--- Page 44 ---
 
40
The cores of zircons from the Mtuga Aplite sample APL-1, from the Mkushi Mine, yielded a range 
of 207Pb/206Pb ages between 2072 ± 9 Ma and 2009 ± 4 Ma. Zircons from Mtuga aplite sample 
APL-2 have inherited cores that range in age mainly from 2064 ± 15 to 1998 ± 18 Ma, with two 
older ages of 2730 ± 7 and 2688 ± 8 Ma. The age range of the zircon cores from the two aplites 
encompasses the age of the 2049 Ma Mkushi Gneiss, as well as the 2050–2020 Ma range of detrital 
zircon core ages from the Serenje paragneisses and migmatites north of Mkushi (De Waele and 
Mapani, 2002). Hence, the zircon cores from the Mtuga aplites are interpreted as being xenocrystic 
and may be inherited from a protolith similar to the Serenje Gneisses and migmatites, which 
underwent partial melting. Omenetto (1973, 1974) had argued earlier that the mineralized aplites 
from the Mkushi area were derived from “granitization”, regarded as the time as melting, of a 
sedimentary paragneiss precursor which contained disseminated Cu mineralization which was 
partitioned into the granitic melt.  
 
The two Neoarchaean zircon cores from APL-2, at 2730 ± 7 Ma and 2688 ± 8 Ma, are the only 
Archaean xenocrysts found in any of the basement granitoids. If, as argued above, the aplites are 
derived from partial melting of a metasedimentary paragneiss precursor, then the Archaean zircons 
would have to have been part of the detrital zircon population in the metasediment. The two 
Archaean zircon core ages are also similar to the ages of detrital monazites found in Irumide 
quartzites from the Irumi Hills (near Mkushi), and the Changwena Hill (SW of Serenje), which 
have respectively been dated at 2720 ± 24 Ma and 2720 ± 20 Ma (Snelling et al., 1964). The source 
of these Archaean detrital zircons and monazites is likely to be the newly discovered gneisses at 
Kampoya quarry, some 40 km northwest of Mkushi Mine, which have been dated at 2730 Ma (De 
Waele and Fitzsimons, 2004). The ages of detrital zircons and monazites in the Irumide Belt also 
correspond with the ages of detrital zircons found in the Muva quartzite south of Mufulira in the 
Copperbelt, which range from 1991 to 3180 Ma, including a cluster of ages between 2708 ± 18 and 
2463 ± 25 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2003). However, Mesoarchaean zircons dated between 3200 to 3000 
Ma, which are present in the Muva quartzites near Mufulira, are absent from the detrital population 
in quartzites and paragneisses in the Irumide Belt (De Waele and Fitzsimons, 2004), as well as in 
the xenocrystic zircon population in aplites derived by partial melting of the Irumide 
metasediments. This suggests that the detrital zircon populations in the Muva quartzites have a 
different origin from those in the Irumide quartzites and paragneisses. The Muva quartzites of the 
Copperbelt include detrital components from the Mesoarchaean Likasi terrane of the southern 
Congo Craton (Rainaud et al., 2003), and could only have been deposited after the amalgamation of 
the Kambantan terrane with the Congo Craton during the Kibaran Orogeny. Thus, despite 
containing no detrital zircons younger than 1941 Ma (Rainaud et al., 2003), the Muva in the 
Copperbelt may represent some kind of post-orogenic molasse deposit following the Kibaran 
Orogeny. 
 
Sample CT169/1256, from the Samba prospect, yielded three inherited zircons dated at 2423 ± 13, 
2336 ± 9 and 2160 ± 25 Ma respectively. The youngest of these xenocrystic zircons (2160 ± 25 
Ma) has an age similar to the oldest xenocryst from Mufulira, dated at 2174 ± 13 Ma, and is likely 
to be derived from a similar source. The two older xenocrysts from Samba indicate the presence of 
crustal components as old as 2420–2330 Ma in the source region, or in the path of ascent, of the 
magmas that produced the precursor volcanic rocks to the Samba Lufubu schists.  
 
Fine pyroclastic layers from the Neoproterozoic Katangan sequence (sample Etoile 1) yielded two 
Mesoarchaean zircons at 2831 ± 16 Ma and 2802 ± 36 Ma and one Palaeoproterozoic zircon at 
1858 ± 24 Ma. As is the case for Archaean zircons in tuffs from the overlying Mwashya Group, the 
two Archaean zircons from the Etoile 1 tuff sample may be derived from cryptic Archaean terranes 
which have been tectonically overridden by the Lufilian arc, such as the Likasi terrane, or other 
portions of the Congo Craton (Rainaud et al., 2003). Ages of c. 2800 Ma have been found in the 
southern exposed part of the Congo Craton in the Kasai region (Delhal et al., 1976). A xenocrystic 

--- Page 45 ---
 
41
zircon dated at 2839 ± 22 Ma was reported from a foliated Archaean granite in the Mwinilunga area 
of NW Zambia, which had an intrusive age of 2538 ± 10 Ma (Key et al., 2001). The third zircon, in 
the Etoile 1 sample, with an age of 1858 Ma, is clearly derived from the Palaeoproterozoic 
basement of the Copperbelt, the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex.  
 
Inherited zircons from the Samba porphyry and Mufulira Lufubu schists may derive from cryptic 
terranes ranging in age from 2400 Ma to 2100 Ma. No rocks of such an age have yet been dated 
from the Copperbelt basement. Finally, no sample of the Lufubu schists or the Palaeoproterozoic 
granitoids has yielded xenocrystic zircons with Archaean ages. This suggests that the protoliths of 
the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex developed as juvenile crust far from older continental 
influences, in an oceanic island arc environment rather than in an Andean-type arc.  
 
Nd and Pb isotopic studies of Damaran metasedimentary and granitoid rocks by Hawkesworth et al. 
(1981) and Hawkesworth and Marlow (1983) indicate these rocks were derived from basement 
rocks up to 2000 Ma in age, and suggest an absence of any significantly older crust beneath the 
Damara Orogen. However, just as the detrital zircons from the Muva cover rocks of the Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex have much older ages, indicating partial derivation from an Archaean 
terrane (Rainaud et al., 2003), so also do detrital zircons from Damaran cover rocks have much 
older ages than their immediate basement. Jacob et al. (2000) have dated detrital zircons from the 
Damaran metasediments that host the Navachab gold deposit in the Karibib District, and have 
obtained SHRIMP U-Pb ages of 2872 ± 4 Ma, 2870 ± 6 Ma, 2428 ± 9 Ma, 2360 ± 5 Ma, and 1962 
± 10 Ma. The c. 2800–2400 Ga ages are similar to ages obtained from the Congo Craton in Kasai, 
DRC (Delhal and Ledent, 1973; Delhal et al., 1976), and they also encompass the age range of 
xenocrystic zircons from the Samba metavolcanics and the Katangan pyroclastics from the 
Copperbelt (see above). This may suggest that by the time the Neoproterozoic Katangan and 
Damaran sedimentation occurred, the Kambantan terrane had already been sutured to the Archaean 
Kasai-Angola Block, from which detrital components were shed into cover sequences on the 
younger terrane. Although no Archaean detrital zircons have yet been found in the Katanga 
Supergroup (Master et al., 2005), detrital platinoids in Katangan sediments at Mutoshi in the 
Kolwezi area have been inferred to be derived from the Archaean Kasai-Angola Block (Jedwab, 
1997). In these same Katangan sediments, Jedwab (1997) also reported detrital cassiterite grains 
which were probably derived from erosion of late Kibaran tin-granites. 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
 
The basement to the Katangan Supergroup in the Central African Copperbelt consists of the Lufubu 
schists and various granitoids and gneisses, which constitute the newly defined Lufubu 
Metamorphic Complex. The Lufubu schists represent a long-lived calc-alkaline volcanic arc 
sequence and, where dated in both Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), yield 
ages of 1980 ± 7, 1968 ± 9, 1964 ± 12 and 1874 ± 8 Ma. The Mkushi granitic gneiss from south-
east of the Zambian Copperbelt, has an age of 2049 ± 6 Ma. An augen gneiss, from the Mulungushi 
Bridge locality, yielded an emplacement age of 1976 ± 5 Ma. More evolved granitoids from the 
Copperbelt itself, the Mufulira Pink Granite and the Chambishi Granite, gave ages of 1994 ± 7 and 
1983 ± 5 Ma respectively. These gneisses, granitoids and acid-intermediate calc-alkaline 
metavolcanics are considered to represent stages in the evolution of a magmatic arc or several arcs 
that formed episodically over a 200 million year period between 2050 and 1850 Ma. The 
undeformed, copper-mineralized Mtuga aplites, which crosscut the foliation in the Mkushi 
gneisses, have xenocrystic cores similar in age to the gneisses, with overgrowths dated at 1059 ± 26 
Ma, regarded as the age of igneous emplacement of these aplites, which thus intruded during the 
Irumide Orogeny.

We interpret the rocks of the Lufubu Metamorphic Complex as belonging to a regionally extensive 
Palaeoproterozoic magmatic arc terrane stretching from northern Namibia to northern Zambia and 
the Marungu Plateau of the DRC, the Kamanjab-Bangweulu terrane, which collided with the 
Archaean Tanzanian Craton during the c. 2000–1900 Ma Ubendian Orogeny, to produce a new 
composite minicontinental entity that we term the “Kambantan” terrane. The Kambantan terrane 
was accreted onto the southern margin of the Congo Craton during the Mesoproterozoic c. 1400–
1000 Ma Kibaran Orogeny. The outboard side of the Kambantan terrane was the site of the c. 
1050–1020 Ma Irumide Orogeny, caused by the collision of several terranes with the Congo 
Craton. Part of the Irumide Belt subsequently rifted off at c. 750–730 Ma, leading to the formation 
of a rifted passive margin during sedimentation of the Damara and Katanga Supergroups, and the 
opening of an ocean basin which closed during the Pan-African Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, when 
the Congo and Kalahari Cratons were sutured together.
