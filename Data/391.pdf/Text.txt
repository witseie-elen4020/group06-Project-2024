MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF 
METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING 
THE PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY 
 
ABSTRACT 
New SHRIMP U-Pb age data on metamorphic monazite, as well as step-heating 40Ar-39Ar 
ages on metamorphic biotite, muscovite and microcline, from Katangan metasedimentary 
rocks of the Central African Copperbelt are presented. These rocks were deformed and 
metamorphosed during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. Three samples of metamorphic 
monazite from the Chambishi structural basin give ages of 592 ± 22 Ma, 531 ± 12 Ma and 
512 ± 17 Ma, which correspond respectively to the ages of eclogite facies metamorphism, 
high pressure talc-kyanite whiteschist metamorphism, and of a regional metamorphism/ 
mineralisation pulse elsewhere within the Lufilian Orogen. A biotite population from 
Luanshya gives a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 586.1 ± 1.7 Ma, coinciding with the oldest 
monazite age. Several samples from the Chambishi basin and the Konkola area give 40Ar/39Ar 
biotite plateau ages in the range of 496.6 ± 0.6 to 485.2 ±  0.9 Ma, and a muscovite plateau 
age of 483.6 ± 1.1 Ma, which are a manifestation of regional uplift and cooling that affected 
the whole Katangan basin. The youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from 
microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma to 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma, reflecting continued 
slow cooling of the Lufilian Orogen.

 MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF 
METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING THE 
PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This paper is part of a wider geochronological study of the Central African Copperbelt and its 
basement. After constraining the nature and evolution of the basement of the Copperbelt (Rainaud et 
al. 2003, 2005), and the provenance of key units within the Katanga Supergroup and their ages (Master 
et al., 2005), in this paper we provide new data dealing with the several metamorphic episodes which 
occurred in the Central African Copperbelt during the Lufilian Orogeny, and discuss their implications 
for the evolution of the Katangan basin 
 
REGIONAL SETTING 
 
The Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits, as well as 
numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe etc., which constitute the Central African Copperbelt 
in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This succession is a Neoproterozoic 
metasedimentary sequence which consists of the Roan Group, the Nguba Group, the Fungurume and 
the Biano Groups (Wendorff, 2001a,b; 2002a,b; 2003a,b; Cailteux, 2003). The lowermost Roan Group 
was deposited after c. 880 Ma (Armstrong et al., 1999), and is subdivided into the mainly siliciclastic 
Lower Roan Subgroup, and the mainly dolomitic and evaporitic Upper Roan Subgroup (Master et al., 
2005). The base of the Nguba Group, the Mwashya Subgroup, was deposited at around 765 Ma (Key et 
al., 2001), while porphyritic lavas attributed to the upper part of the Nguba Group were dated at 735 
Ma (Armstrong, 2000; Liyungu et al., 2001; Key et al., 2001). The Mwashya Subgroup is overlain by 
the Grand Conglomerat Member, which is a glacial tillite (Master et al., 2005). Finally, the Fungurume 
and Biano Groups were deposited syntectonically in a foreland basin during the Lufilian Orogeny, after 
c. 572 Ma (Wendorff, 2003a; Master et al., 2005).  
 
The Katanga Supergroup was deformed and metamorphosed during the Pan-African Zambezi and 
Lufilian orogenies (Porada and Berhorst, 2000), at between 600 and 480 Ma. Metamorphism in the 
Zambian Copperbelt was mainly of greenschist facies, except at Muliashi, where epidote-amphibolite 
facies assemblages were recognised, characterised by the presence of tremolite, biotite, epidote and 
actinolite in impure dolomites, and of scapolite and clinozoisite in argillites (Mendelsohn, 1961). In the 
Domes area to the west of the Copperbelt, amphibolite facies assemblages are recognised (Cosi et al., 
1992). A large number of imprecise U-Pb, Rb-Sr and K-Ar age data from the Lufilian Arc and 
Zambezi Belt, spanning the time period 500 ± 100 Ma are summarised by Cahen et al. (1984). More 
recently, the Kipushi deposit was dated at 454 Ma (Walraven and Chabu, 1994) but was also 
recalculated at 750 Ma using a three-stage model (Kampunzu et al., 1998). In the Musoshi district, U-
Pb analyses on uraninite and rutile yielded ages of c. 514 Ma (Richards et al., 1988a, b). Molybdenite 
from Kansanshi (Zambia) yielded ages of c. 512 and 502 Ma with the Re-Os technique (Torrealday et 
al., 2000). Eclogites from Central Zambia yielded a Sm-Nd isochron at 595 ± 10 Ma (John et al., 2003) 
while a phase of high-pressure whiteschist metamorphism yielded a U-Pb monazite age of 529 ± 2 Ma 
(John et al., 2004). 
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses were performed at the Research School of Earth Sciences (RSES), Australian 
National University, Canberra. Muscovites were separated at the the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory,

University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples were reduced in a jaw crusher 
and through a pulverizer into a coarse powder which was then sieved. Extracts were purified at the 
Australian National University, using conventional magnetic separation and heavy liquid techniques. 
The resulting separates were of ~99% or higher purity. The 40Ar/39Ar dating technique used was 
described in detail by McDougall and Harrison (1999). Crystals were placed into an aluminium 
irradiation canister together with interspersed aliquots of the flux monitor GA 1550 (age = 98.5 Ma; 
Spell and McDougall, 2003). Packets containing degassed potassium glass were placed at either end of 
the canister to monitor the 40Ar production from potassium (e.g. Tetley, 1980). The irradiation canister 
was irradiated for 504 hours in position X34 of the ANSTO, HIFAR reactor, Lucas Heights, New 
South Wales, Australia. The canister, which was lined with 0.2 mm Cd to absorb thermal neutrons, was 
inverted three times during the irradiation, which reduced neutron flux gradients to < 2% along the 
length of the canister. Mass discrimination was monitored by analyses of standard air volumes. 
Correction factors for interfering reactions are as follows: (40Ar/39Ar)Ca = 3.50(± 0.14)x10-4; 
(39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 7.86(± 0.01)x10-4 (McDougall and Harrison, 1999); (40Ar/39Ar)K = 0.050 (± 0.005). 
K/Ca ratios were determined from the ANU laboratory hornblende standard 77-600 and were 
calculated as follows: K/Ca = 1.9 x 39Ar/37Ar. The reported data have been corrected for system 
blanks, mass discrimination and radioactive decay. The calculated ages have been corrected 
additionally for reactor interferences, fluence gradients and atmospheric contamination. Errors 
associated with the age determinations are one sigma uncertainties and include errors in the J-value 
estimates. The error on the J-value is ± 0.35 %, excluding the uncertainty in the age of GA1550 (which 
is ~ 1%). Decay constants are those of Steiger and Jäger (1977). 
 
Plateau portions of the age spectra are defined as comprising at least three contiguous increments, with 
concordant ages (i.e. ages that are within two sigma of the mean age). In addition, this segment should 
contain a significant proportion of the total 39Ar released (MacDougall, 1999).  
 
U-Pb analyses were performed on the SHRIMP II ion microprobe at the Australian National 
University, Canberra. The separation of monazites was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, 
Johannesburg, using a Wilfley Table, a Frantz Isodynamic Magnetic Separator, and heavy liquids. The 
SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. 
(1995). Age calculations and plotting were done using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000). 
 
SAMPLING 
 
Eleven samples were utilised for the purpose of this study (Fig. 1): seven were located in the 
Chambishi basin in Zambia (Fig. 2), one in the Konkola area (also in Zambia), one in the Muliashi 
South deposit (Zambia, near Luanshya), one in the Nchanga mine (Zambia) and finally, one in the 
Musoshi Mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 1). Two of these samples were dated by two 
methods. 
 
In one sample (sample RCB2/112), monazites were extracted and dated with the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique while a population of biotite crystals was analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. With the 
sample KN1A (from the Konkola area) muscovite and biotite crystal populations were dated with the 
40Ar-39Ar dating technique. Monazites from three samples collected in the Chambishi basin were 
analysed using the SHRIMP U-Pb technique. Biotite from six samples and microclines from one 
sample were analysed using the 40Ar-39Ar technique. All samples are derived from the Lower Roan 
Subgroup up to the Grand Conglomerat Formation (Fig. 3).

RESULTS 
 
Samples analysed and dated in this study yielded several distinct age ranges. Three samples give an 
age range between 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 586.1 ± 1.7 Ma, 6 samples give an age range between 496.6 ± 
0.6 Ma and 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma while individual samples give ages of 531 ± 12 Ma and 512 ± 17 Ma. 
 
Muliashi South deposit (Luanshya), sample BH89/3, biotite 
 
Borehole BH89 is located on the southern flank of the Roan Antelope synclinorium and more precisely 
on the Muliashi South deposit (Fig. 1) where reserves are estimated at 22 Mt grading at 2.32% Cu 
(Mbendi, 2002). This bore hole is 975.36 m deep and reaches the pre-Katangan basement. Sample 
BH89/3 is located 743 m below the surface and at 35 m above the contact between the sedimentary 
sequence and the pre-Katangan basement. Stratigraphically, the sample is situated within the Ore Shale 
Formation at the base of the Upper Roan Subgroup. It is a biotite-tremolite-quartz schist with a 
porphyroblastic texture which also contains bornite and chalcopyrite. Retrograde metamorphism is 
reflected by biotite being replaced by chlorite. Step-heating 40Ar-39Ar was undertaken on a 0.47 mg 
population of biotite. Data are reported in a diagram of age versus %39Ar released (Fig. 4 and Table 1). 
The first apparent age, connected to a degassing temperature of 600ºC, is 469.5 ± 6.7 Ma and 
corresponds to 0.934% of the 39Ar released. The diagram presents two peaks at the temperatures 680ºC 
and 850ºC with apparent ages at 602.5 ± 2.8 Ma and 602.2 ± 2.3 Ma respectively. Between these older 
apparent ages and for 55.52% of the 39Ar released (equivalent to 5 consecutive increments), the 
apparent ages vary between 583.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 588.7 ± 1.5 Ma and yield a plateau age at 586.1 ± 1.7 
Ma with a MSWD at 1.4. The steps following the second peak, at 950ºC and 1050ºC show similar ages

Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/72, monazite  
 
Borehole RCB2 is 1840.68 m long and is located at the western limit of the Chambishi Southeast 
prospect (Fig. 2). It reaches the basal conglomerate of the Katangan sedimentary sequence. This 
sample was collected at a depth of 497 m and is stratigraphically situated in the Mwashya Subgroup. 
Sample RCB2/72 is from an iron formation interbedded with an altered tuff (biotite retrograded to 
chlorite, quartz and carbonate). Monazites are anhedral and green, intergrown with biotite or chlorite 
and clearly of metamorphic origin. Metamorphic monazites were analysed using the U-Pb SHRIMP 
technique. Data are reported in a Tera-Wasserburg diagram, Figure 5 and in Table 2. Analyses plot on 
a discordia intercepting the concordia curve. The weighted mean 206Pb/238U age is 592 ± 22 Ma, which 
is interpreted as the age of formation of these monazites.

Chambishi basin, sample NN75/26, biotite  
 
Borehole NN75 is located in the northeast area of the Chambishi basin, designated as the Southeast 
prospect (Fig. 2). It is 1033.78 m long, and penetrates the Katanga Supergroup to reach a granite that 
forms, together with the Lufubu schists, the local pre-Katangan basement (Rainaud et al., 2005). The 
sample NN75/26 was collected at a depth of 148 m, in a magnetite-rich iron-formation located 2 m 
below a tuffaceous layer in the Mwashya Subgroup. Between the grains of iron oxides, intergrowths of 
chlorite - biotite, calcite  and  quartz are developed.  A population of biotite crystals, weighing 1.00 mg

Figure 5.   Tera-Wasserburg diagram, sample RCB2/72 
 
was analysed by the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Data are reported in a diagram of age versus %39Ar released 
(Fig. 6; Table 3). This diagram presents a hump-shaped 40Ar-39Ar age profile. Apparent ages vary 
between 53.7 ± 1.0 Ma and 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma for temperatures between 650ºC and 970ºC. For 
temperatures between 1000ºC and 1100ºC, apparent ages vary between 614.7 ± 1.8 Ma and 554.4 ± 3.1 
Ma. No plateau age can be extracted and apparent ages are greater than the ones previously yielded by 
other samples.  
 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB1/36, monazite  
 
Borehole RCB1 is located 5 km west of RCB2 (Fig. 2) and is 1686.2 m deep. RCB1/36 was sampled at 
1284 m and is stratigraphically located in the Upper Roan Subgroup. This sample is a metapelite 
including biotite, quartz and K-feldspar. As seen previously in sample RCB272, monazites are green, 
anhedral and clearly metamorphic. They were extracted and analysed with the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique. Results are reported in Table 4 and presented in a Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram in 
Figure 7. Plots are clustered near the concordia and the weighted mean yields a 206Pb/238U age of 531 ± 
12 Ma. This age is interpreted as the age of formation of the monazites. 
 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/112, monazite  
 
Sample RCB2/112 was taken at a depth of 528 m, in the borehole RCB2. This sample is a marly 
dolomitic argillite from the Mwashya Subgroup. Monazites were analysed with the U-Pb SHRIMP 
dating technique. Data are reported in a Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram (Fig. 8; Table 5). 
Analyses plot in a cluster and yield weighted mean 206Pb/238U at 512 ± 17 Ma. This age is interpreted 
as the age of formation of these monazites.

Figure 8.   Tera-Wasserburg diagram, sample RCB2/112 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/112, biotite  
 
After obtaining the U-Pb SHRIMP age data on monazites (see above), a population of biotite grains 
weighing 0.83 mg was separated. The biotite grains were dated with the 40Ar-39Ar technique and the 
results are reported in Table 6 and the age data plotted in Figure 9. The first step at 650ºC yields a very 
young apparent age at 307.2 ± 2.6 Ma. The next two steps at 700ºC and 740ºC produce older ages of 
458.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 486.1 ± 1.5 Ma. The next seven steps, with temperatures between 760ºC and 
940ºC, yield apparent ages between 488.5 ± 1.5 Ma and 494.7 ±1.8 Ma. The extracted plateau age of 
this section is of 491.5 ± 1.6 Ma, with a MSWD = 1.7, and corresponds to 66.4% of the 39Ar released.  
The last section of the spectrum yields two older apparent ages (at 496.0 ± 1.2 Ma and 497.7 ± 1.4 Ma) 
and finally a much younger apparent age at 456.3 ± 8.1 Ma.

Figure 9.   Age vs. 39Ar released diagram, sample RCB2/112 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/4, biotite  
 
This sample is from the Lower Roan Subgroup and was collected at a depth of 1468 m from borehole 
RCB2. It is from a 0.5m thick biotite-bearing trough-crossbedded sandstone interbedded with 
conglomerates of the basal Roan Group. A population of biotite grains from this sample was analysed 
and the results are reported in Table 7, and plotted in Figure 10. The two first steps, at 650 ºC and 
700ºC, present apparent ages at 468.3 ± 3.6 Ma and 484.9 ± 1.6 Ma respectively. The following seven 
steps, for temperatures between 720ºC and 800 ºC, yield apparent ages ranging from 488.8 ± 1.7 Ma to 
493.4 ± 1.7 Ma. These seven apparent ages yield a plateau age at 490.9 ± 0.6 Ma with a MSWD = 1.2 
and with 75% of the 39Ar released. The following step at 850ºC presents a peak in the apparent ages at 
495.2 ± 1.8 Ma. The last three steps at 900, 1000 and 1200ºC yield apparent ages at, respectively, 
482.6 ± 2.9 Ma, 488.7 ± 2.0 Ma and 481.7 ± 5.3 Ma. 
 
Chambishi basin, sample MJZC9/25, biotite  
 
Borehole MJZC9 is located in the Chambishi basin, less than 1 km southwest of the borehole NN75 
(Figs. 1 and 2). This borehole is 1140 m deep and the sample MJZC9/25 came from a depth of 152 m. 
The sample is a laminated grey shale located in the Grand Conglomerat Formation, and comprises 
mainly quartz, sericite and biotite. A population of biotite crystals weighing 0.3 mg was separated and 
analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Results of analyses are reported in Table 8 and in an age 
spectrum (Fig. 11). The first two steps at 650ºC and 740ºC yield apparent ages at 393.1 ± 6.0 Ma and 
481.0 ± 1.3 Ma. The following five steps, between 760ºC and 880ºC, yield apparent ages ranging 
between 487.3 ± 4.1 and 483.0 ± 1.9 Ma and a plateau age at 485.2 Ma ± 0.9 Ma (with a MSWD at 
0.7) which corresponds to 62.4 % of the 39Ar released. The last part of the spectrum, from 950ºC to 
1100ºC, presents a convex shape with a peak of apparent age at 490.8 ± 1.8 Ma (at 950ºC). 
 
Chambishi basin, sample NN75/9, biotite 
 
Sample NN75/9 was taken at a depth of 893.6 m in borehole NN75, in the Chambishi Basin. It is 
located in the hangingwall of the orebody, in the Ore Shale Formation of the Upper Roan Subgroup. 
This sample is a rippled white dolarenite with specks of metamorphic biotite. A population of biotite

crystals weighing 0.44 mg was analysed. The results are reported in Table 9 and in an age versus 
%39Ar  released  diagram (Fig. 12).  The age spectrum presents  two young apparent ages (456.4 ± 13.1 
and 459.8 ± 6.0 Ma) at the first two temperature steps (600ºC and 680ºC). The following step at 720ºC 
yields an apparent age at 480.8 ± 3.6 Ma. Apparent ages from step 4 (at 760ºC) to step 12 (at 1300ºC) 
vary from 491.0 ± 1.6 Ma to 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma. These 9 steps yield, with 97.1% of 39Ar released, a 
plateau age at 488.0 ± 0.5 Ma with a MSWD at 1.5.

Nchanga, sample NCH1, biotite 
 
Sample NCH1 comes from the lower orebody from Nchanga Mine, in the so-called “Lower Banded 
Shale” or “LBS” unit, corresponding to the Orebody Formation of the basal Upper Roan Subgroup. It 
is a graphitic siltstone with quartz, K-feldspar, detrital muscovite and metamorphic biotite. A 
population of biotite crystals weighing 0.81 mg was analysed with the 40Ar/39Ar technique. Results of 
analyses are reported in an age versus %39Ar released diagram (Fig. 13) and in Table 10. The first step 
at 650ºC, yields a younger apparent age at 435.3 ± 2.7 Ma. The steps at 1060ºC and at 1120ºC were 
lost during manipulation. Steps before and after the loss are similar, within error at 487.7 ± 1.3 Ma and 
489.3 ± 3.1 Ma.

Figure 13.  Age vs. 39Ar released diagram, sample NCH1 
Konkola, sample KN1A, biotite and muscovite  
 
Sample KN1A comes from the Konkola area, northern Zambia. Stratigraphically, it is located in the 
Lower Roan Subgroup. The sample is a greenish siltstone containing mainly quartz, biotite and 
muscovite with minor K-feldspar. Analyses of 40Ar-39Ar were done on a population of biotite grains, as 
well as on a separate population of muscovite grains from the same sample.  
 
• Biotite: Results of analyses of a biotite population weighing 0.38 mg are reported in Figure 14 
and Table 11. The first step at 600°C yielded a young apparent age at 181.6 ± 5.2 Ma 
(corresponding to 1.57% of 39Ar released). The second apparent age, at 700°C, is older, at 
483.7 ± 1.7 Ma (corresponding to 12.68% of the 39Ar released). The five following steps, for 
temperatures between 740°C and 850°C, give a plateau age at 496.6 ± 0.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.45, 
61.5% of 39Ar released) and apparent ages varying between 497.3 ± 1.3 Ma and 494.0 ± 2.1 
Ma. The two next steps at temperatures of 920°C and 1100°C yield older apparent ages at 503.2 
± 3.2 Ma and 515.1 ± 2.1 Ma respectively (for a total of 24.0% of 39Ar released). Finally the 
last step, at 1300°C, yielded a younger apparent age at 342.7 ± 47.7 Ma but corresponds to only 
0.22% of the 39Ar released. 
 
• Muscovite: A population of muscovite crystals weighing 0.58 mg was analysed. Results are 
reported in an age spectrum diagram (Fig. 15) and in Table 12. The first step at 700°C, with 
5.45% of 39Ar released, yielded an apparent age of 415.1 ± 2.3 Ma. The second step, at 800°C 
shows a sudden increase of the apparent age at 515.8 ± 1.6 Ma. The third step at 850 °C yielded 
a younger apparent age than at the previous step, with 489.8 ± 0.7 Ma. From the fourth step (at 
900°C) to the eighth step (at 1050°C), the spectrum presents a plateau age at 483.6 ± 1.1 Ma, 
MSWD = 2.1, corresponding to 69.4% of the 39Ar released with apparent ages varying from 
485.4 ± 1.3 Ma to 481.5 ± 1.0 Ma.

DISCUSSION 
 
The deposition of the Katangan sequence started somewhere after 877 Ma (Armstrong et al., 2004) and 
finished sometime after 573 ± 5 Ma (Master et al., 2005). Following deposition, the Katangan 
sedimentary sequence underwent several episodes of metamorphism during the late Neoproterozoic 
Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny, which gave the Copperbelt its arcuate shape (Cahen et al., 1984; Cosi 
et al., 1992).

Geochronology 
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses of all biotite, muscovite and microcline samples yielded degassing patterns with 
well-known features. All the samples showed very young apparent ages associated with low 
temperatures of degassing. These young apparent ages can be related to the release of the argon located 
in the external, least retentive sites of the minerals. The energy necessary to release the argon in these 
sites is minimal and the slightest thermal disturbance could produce a loss of argon (Hanes, 1991). A 
common feature in biotite degassing patterns is the presence of two peaks in the apparent ages at 
680°C and 850°C. The first peak at around 650°C represents released argon related to a stage of 
dehydroxylation of the biotite, while the second peak at 850°C can be related to one phase of 
dehydroxylation of chlorite (Lo and Onstott, 1989). 
 
The justification for using two methods of analyses lies in the difference between their closure 
temperatures. For the biotite and muscovite and in the case of 40Ar-39Ar analyses, closure temperatures 
are between 300-400°C. For monazite in U-Pb analyses, Parrish (1990) evaluated the closure 
temperature at 725 ± 25 °C, while more recent studies (Cherniak et al., 2002) estimate it at more than 
900 °C. Hence, ages obtained for analyses on monazite give the age of crystallisation of these minerals 
or the age of a metamorphic event in the case of overgrowths. As seen in the samples analysed, 
monazites commonly do not lie on the Concordia curve. This behaviour is attributed to the presence of 
excess 206Pb formed by the initial incorporation of 230Th (Heaman and Parrish, 1991). Ages obtained 
using the 40Ar-39Ar technique are not as straightforward to interpret. While a plateau age gives the age 
of a metamorphic event, in general, ages produced with the 40Ar-39Ar technique commonly generate 
problems of interpretation.  
 
In this study, ten populations of biotite, muscovite and microcline grains were analysed using the 40Ar-
39Ar technique. Out of these ten samples, three (NN75/26, NCH1 and MUS1) do not yield plateau ages 
as defined by MacDougall (1999). In this section we discuss the provisos related to the interpretation 
of these three samples. Sample NN75/26, which was collected from an iron-formation located 2 m 
below a tuffaceous layer, yielded a hump-shaped curve on an age vs %39Ar released diagram, with 
apparent ages ranging from 53.7 ± 1.0 Ma to 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma, which implies a thermal disturbance of

the system (Lo and Onstott, 1989; Di Vicenzo et al., 2003). The maximum apparent ages of this 
sample are significantly older than ages yielded by other samples from this area and from this drill 
hole. The 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma apparent age is the highest recorded during this study but is difficult to 
interpret because it occurs without the presence of a plateau age. Still, this age can be found elsewhere 
in the Lufilian Arc (Cosi et al., 1992). One plausible explanation for the disturbed age spectrum 
yielded by the sample NN75/26 is the incorporation of an excess of argon in the biotite. It is difficult to 
pin-point the cause of this excess. The emplacement of the tuffaceous layer below which the sample 
was extracted cannot explain this argon excess. The temperatures involved were too low and the 
thermal effects on the surrounding rocks were minimal. Although the biotite was separated with 
extreme care in order to obtain pristine biotite, it is possible that some chloritised biotite may have 
been included in the analysed population of grains. The excess of argon may then have been associated 
with the chlorite (Lo and Onstott, 1989). Problems with the sample NCH1 from Nchanga Mine were 
purely technical and induced a partial loss of argon. It should be noted that the apparent age before the 
loss, 487.7 ± 1.3 Ma, is similar within error, to the apparent age following the lost step due to the 
technical problem, at 489.3 ± 3.1 Ma. Finally, microclines (from sample MUS1) were also analysed 
with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. This sample does not yield a plateau age but instead shows gradually 
increasing apparent ages between 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma and 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma. It is not uncommon to find these 
age spectra for potassium feldspars. These minerals do not have one closure temperature but a range of 
closure temperatures ranging from 350°C to 125°C (Foland, 1974; Purdy and Jäger, 1976; Harrison 
and McDougall, 1982; Lovera et al., 1989). A spectrum without a plateau age may imply a slow 
cooling, but it is difficult to quantify the rate at which it occurs without a complete 40Ar-39Ar study of 
K-feldspars from the area.

In the present study, Ar-Ar and U-Pb SHRIMP analyses were performed on several samples collected 
from a stratigraphic succession extending from the Lower Roan Subgroup to the Grand Conglomerat 
Formation. A summary of the ages obtained in this study is given in Table 14. The ages obtained do 
not represent a continuum but rather several distinct groupings. Three samples yielded ages between 
631.8 ± 1.8 and 592 ± 22 Ma. This age span is recorded in other parts of the Central African 
Copperbelt and in the Irumide Belt. In central Zambia a phase of eclogite facies metamorphism was 
dated at 595 ± 10 Ma, based on a Sm-Nd age on garnet and whole rock in eclogite (John et al., 2003). 
In the Zambian Copperbelt, Re-Os analyses on rocks from the Nkana, Chibuluma and Nchanga 
deposits yielded an isochron age of 583 ± 24 Ma (Barra et al., 2004). A similar, but reset, Rb-Sr age of 
582 ± 40 Ma was obtained (Cahen et al., 1984) for the Kafue Rhyolite, which has a U-Pb zircon age of 
c. 879 Ma (Hanson et al., 1994). U-Th-Pb analyses on monazites from the Luiswishi Cu-Co-U deposits 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo gave ages between 603 ± 31 Ma and 556 ± 29 Ma (Lerouge et 
al., 2004). The age of 531 ± 12 Ma obtained in this study with the U-Pb technique on metamorphic 
monazites from the Chambishi basin is similar to others found elsewhere in the Lufilian arc and the 
Zambezi Belt. Monazite from a biotite-kyanite-garnet gneiss showed an U-Pb age of 529 ± 2 Ma while 
the same minerals from some whiteschists yielded 207Pb/235U ages of 531 to 532 ± 2 Ma (John et al., 
2004). Molybdenite from the Nkana deposit yielded an age of 525.7 ± 3.4 Ma with the Re-Os 
technique (Barra et al., 2004). In central Zambia, an unfolded rhyolite in the Katangan sedimentary 
sequence was dated with the U-Pb zircon leaching technique at 538.0 ± 1.5 Ma (Hanson et al., 1993). 
Recent U-Th-Pb analyses on monazites of sediments from the Luiswishi deposit yielded an age of 556 
± 29 Ma (Lerouge et al., 2004). Analyses on monazites and rutiles from the Kalumbila deposit in 
northwest Zambia yielded U-Pb ages of 548.6 ± 7.6 Ma and 531 ± 21 Ma respectively (Steven and 
Armstrong, 2003). The age of 512 ± 17 Ma, obtained from the last set of analysed monazites 
(RCB1/36), was also found elsewhere in the Copperbelt. Richards et al. (1988a, b) analysed rutiles and 
uraninites associated with veining crosscutting the ore body of the Musoshi deposit. The ages for rutile 
and uraninite are identical with 514 ± 2 Ma and 514 ± 3 Ma. More recently, Re-Os and U-Pb analyses 
of respectively molybdenite and monazite yielded ages of 511.8 ± 1.7 Ma (molybdenite), 512.9 ± 1.7 
Ma  (molybdenite) and 509 ± 11 Ma (monazite) (Torrealday et al., 2000).  
 
The last and largest set of samples yielded the youngest age range, between 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma and 496.6 
± 0.6 Ma. Similar ages are widely recorded in the Copperbelt and adjacent areas. In the Domes area, 
west of the Zambian Copperbelt, Cosi et al. (1992) obtained a large set of K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages 
ranging from 475 ± 6 Ma to 492 ± 6 Ma. Furthermore, Cahen and Snelling (1971) obtained a K-Ar age 
of 483 ± 15 Ma for lavas located in the Kibambale area as well as K-Ar biotite ages from Nkana, 
Nchanga and Kinsenda ranging between 495 and 422 Ma.  
 
Regional implications 
 
During the Neoproterozoic, at c. 750–730 Ma, the southern part of the Congo Craton underwent rifting 
during the opening of the Khomas ocean (Hoffman, 1994). Damaran and Katangan sedimentary rocks 
were deposited in the resulting passive margin (Porada and Berhorst, 2000). During the Pan-African 
Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, the Khomas ocean closed with subduction of oceanic lithosphere 
underneath the Congo Craton margin, leading to the formation of an Andean-type magmatic arc, and 
ultimately to the Himalayan-type collision between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons at about 550-510 
Ma (Miller, 1983; Porada and Berhorst, 2000). Eclogite facies metamorphism from the Zambezi Belt, 
dated at 595 ± 10 Ma, and comprising associated gabbros, metagabbros and eclogite, records the 
timing of the subduction, which took place in an oceanic environment (John et al., 2003).

The ages of c. 590 Ma recorded by both the U-Pb system in monazite, and the 40Ar-39Ar system in 
biotite in the present study show that there was some tectonic activity with attendant metamorphism in 
the Chambishi Basin that was coeval with the eclogite facies metamorphism recorded in the Zambezi 
Belt. The temperatures during this first metamorphic event were higher than during subsequent events, 
as recorded by the epidote-amphibolite facies assemblages at Muliashi. Talc-kyanite whiteschists in the 
Lufilian Arc, dated at c. 530 Ma, represent the final stage of collision between the Congo and the 
Kalahari Cratons (John et al., 2004). Our monazite age of 531 ± 12 Ma is probably related to this 
event. The ages at c. 512 Ma recorded in the Katangan basin are clearly related to a widespread 
mineralising phase (molybdenite, monazite, rutile, uraninite) due to circulation of fluids (Richards et 
al., 1988a,b; Torrealday et al., 2000). The range of 40Ar-39Ar mica ages at c. 492–406 Ma may be 
related to post-orogenic regional uplift and cooling which affected the whole Katangan basin. The 
youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 ± 2.7 
Ma to 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma. This age range encompasses a muscovite Rb-Sr age of 450 ± 9 Ma from 
Malundwe in the Mwombezhi Dome (Cosi et al., 1992). This young metamorphic event corresponds to 
the age (458–427 Ma) of the late nepheline-syenite Mukumbi intrusion north of the Mwombezhi Dome 
(Cosi et al., 1992). Young intrusions of an age similar to the Mukumbi nepheline-syenite have not 
been reported from the Copperbelt region, thus it is likely that the youngest ages recorded by the 
microclines at Musoshi are a reflection of continued post-orogenic uplift and slow cooling of the 
Lufilian orogen.

MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF 
METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING 
THE PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY 
 
ABSTRACT 
New SHRIMP U-Pb age data on metamorphic monazite, as well as step-heating 40Ar-39Ar 
ages on metamorphic biotite, muscovite and microcline, from Katangan metasedimentary 
rocks of the Central African Copperbelt are presented. These rocks were deformed and 
metamorphosed during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. Three samples of metamorphic 
monazite from the Chambishi structural basin give ages of 592 ± 22 Ma, 531 ± 12 Ma and 
512 ± 17 Ma, which correspond respectively to the ages of eclogite facies metamorphism, 
high pressure talc-kyanite whiteschist metamorphism, and of a regional metamorphism/ 
mineralisation pulse elsewhere within the Lufilian Orogen. A biotite population from 
Luanshya gives a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 586.1 ± 1.7 Ma, coinciding with the oldest 
monazite age. Several samples from the Chambishi basin and the Konkola area give 40Ar/39Ar 
biotite plateau ages in the range of 496.6 ± 0.6 to 485.2 ±  0.9 Ma, and a muscovite plateau 
age of 483.6 ± 1.1 Ma, which are a manifestation of regional uplift and cooling that affected 
the whole Katangan basin. The youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from 
microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma to 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma, reflecting continued 
slow cooling of the Lufilian Orogen.

 MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF 
METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING THE 
PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This paper is part of a wider geochronological study of the Central African Copperbelt and its 
basement. After constraining the nature and evolution of the basement of the Copperbelt (Rainaud et 
al. 2003, 2005), and the provenance of key units within the Katanga Supergroup and their ages (Master 
et al., 2005), in this paper we provide new data dealing with the several metamorphic episodes which 
occurred in the Central African Copperbelt during the Lufilian Orogeny, and discuss their implications 
for the evolution of the Katangan basin 
 
REGIONAL SETTING 
 
The Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits, as well as 
numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe etc., which constitute the Central African Copperbelt 
in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This succession is a Neoproterozoic 
metasedimentary sequence which consists of the Roan Group, the Nguba Group, the Fungurume and 
the Biano Groups (Wendorff, 2001a,b; 2002a,b; 2003a,b; Cailteux, 2003). The lowermost Roan Group 
was deposited after c. 880 Ma (Armstrong et al., 1999), and is subdivided into the mainly siliciclastic 
Lower Roan Subgroup, and the mainly dolomitic and evaporitic Upper Roan Subgroup (Master et al., 
2005). The base of the Nguba Group, the Mwashya Subgroup, was deposited at around 765 Ma (Key et 
al., 2001), while porphyritic lavas attributed to the upper part of the Nguba Group were dated at 735 
Ma (Armstrong, 2000; Liyungu et al., 2001; Key et al., 2001). The Mwashya Subgroup is overlain by 
the Grand Conglomerat Member, which is a glacial tillite (Master et al., 2005). Finally, the Fungurume 
and Biano Groups were deposited syntectonically in a foreland basin during the Lufilian Orogeny, after 
c. 572 Ma (Wendorff, 2003a; Master et al., 2005).  
 
The Katanga Supergroup was deformed and metamorphosed during the Pan-African Zambezi and 
Lufilian orogenies (Porada and Berhorst, 2000), at between 600 and 480 Ma. Metamorphism in the 
Zambian Copperbelt was mainly of greenschist facies, except at Muliashi, where epidote-amphibolite 
facies assemblages were recognised, characterised by the presence of tremolite, biotite, epidote and 
actinolite in impure dolomites, and of scapolite and clinozoisite in argillites (Mendelsohn, 1961). In the 
Domes area to the west of the Copperbelt, amphibolite facies assemblages are recognised (Cosi et al., 
1992). A large number of imprecise U-Pb, Rb-Sr and K-Ar age data from the Lufilian Arc and 
Zambezi Belt, spanning the time period 500 ± 100 Ma are summarised by Cahen et al. (1984). More 
recently, the Kipushi deposit was dated at 454 Ma (Walraven and Chabu, 1994) but was also 
recalculated at 750 Ma using a three-stage model (Kampunzu et al., 1998). In the Musoshi district, U-
Pb analyses on uraninite and rutile yielded ages of c. 514 Ma (Richards et al., 1988a, b). Molybdenite 
from Kansanshi (Zambia) yielded ages of c. 512 and 502 Ma with the Re-Os technique (Torrealday et 
al., 2000). Eclogites from Central Zambia yielded a Sm-Nd isochron at 595 ± 10 Ma (John et al., 2003) 
while a phase of high-pressure whiteschist metamorphism yielded a U-Pb monazite age of 529 ± 2 Ma 
(John et al., 2004). 
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses were performed at the Research School of Earth Sciences (RSES), Australian 
National University, Canberra. Muscovites were separated at the the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, 

--- Page 6 ---

University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples were reduced in a jaw crusher 
and through a pulverizer into a coarse powder which was then sieved. Extracts were purified at the 
Australian National University, using conventional magnetic separation and heavy liquid techniques. 
The resulting separates were of ~99% or higher purity. The 40Ar/39Ar dating technique used was 
described in detail by McDougall and Harrison (1999). Crystals were placed into an aluminium 
irradiation canister together with interspersed aliquots of the flux monitor GA 1550 (age = 98.5 Ma; 
Spell and McDougall, 2003). Packets containing degassed potassium glass were placed at either end of 
the canister to monitor the 40Ar production from potassium (e.g. Tetley, 1980). The irradiation canister 
was irradiated for 504 hours in position X34 of the ANSTO, HIFAR reactor, Lucas Heights, New 
South Wales, Australia. The canister, which was lined with 0.2 mm Cd to absorb thermal neutrons, was 
inverted three times during the irradiation, which reduced neutron flux gradients to < 2% along the 
length of the canister. Mass discrimination was monitored by analyses of standard air volumes. 
Correction factors for interfering reactions are as follows: (40Ar/39Ar)Ca = 3.50(± 0.14)x10-4; 
(39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 7.86(± 0.01)x10-4 (McDougall and Harrison, 1999); (40Ar/39Ar)K = 0.050 (± 0.005). 
K/Ca ratios were determined from the ANU laboratory hornblende standard 77-600 and were 
calculated as follows: K/Ca = 1.9 x 39Ar/37Ar. The reported data have been corrected for system 
blanks, mass discrimination and radioactive decay. The calculated ages have been corrected 
additionally for reactor interferences, fluence gradients and atmospheric contamination. Errors 
associated with the age determinations are one sigma uncertainties and include errors in the J-value 
estimates. The error on the J-value is ± 0.35 %, excluding the uncertainty in the age of GA1550 (which 
is ~ 1%). Decay constants are those of Steiger and Jäger (1977). 
 
Plateau portions of the age spectra are defined as comprising at least three contiguous increments, with 
concordant ages (i.e. ages that are within two sigma of the mean age). In addition, this segment should 
contain a significant proportion of the total 39Ar released (MacDougall, 1999).  
 
U-Pb analyses were performed on the SHRIMP II ion microprobe at the Australian National 
University, Canberra. The separation of monazites was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, 
Johannesburg, using a Wilfley Table, a Frantz Isodynamic Magnetic Separator, and heavy liquids. The 
SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. 
(1995). Age calculations and plotting were done using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000). 
 
SAMPLING 
 
Eleven samples were utilised for the purpose of this study (Fig. 1): seven were located in the 
Chambishi basin in Zambia (Fig. 2), one in the Konkola area (also in Zambia), one in the Muliashi 
South deposit (Zambia, near Luanshya), one in the Nchanga mine (Zambia) and finally, one in the 
Musoshi Mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 1). Two of these samples were dated by two 
methods. 
 
In one sample (sample RCB2/112), monazites were extracted and dated with the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique while a population of biotite crystals was analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. With the 
sample KN1A (from the Konkola area) muscovite and biotite crystal populations were dated with the 
40Ar-39Ar dating technique. Monazites from three samples collected in the Chambishi basin were 
analysed using the SHRIMP U-Pb technique. Biotite from six samples and microclines from one 
sample were analysed using the 40Ar-39Ar technique. All samples are derived from the Lower Roan 
Subgroup up to the Grand Conglomerat Formation (Fig. 3).

RESULTS 
 
Samples analysed and dated in this study yielded several distinct age ranges. Three samples give an 
age range between 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 586.1 ± 1.7 Ma, 6 samples give an age range between 496.6 ± 
0.6 Ma and 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma while individual samples give ages of 531 ± 12 Ma and 512 ± 17 Ma. 
 
Muliashi South deposit (Luanshya), sample BH89/3, biotite 
 
Borehole BH89 is located on the southern flank of the Roan Antelope synclinorium and more precisely 
on the Muliashi South deposit (Fig. 1) where reserves are estimated at 22 Mt grading at 2.32% Cu 
(Mbendi, 2002). This bore hole is 975.36 m deep and reaches the pre-Katangan basement. Sample 
BH89/3 is located 743 m below the surface and at 35 m above the contact between the sedimentary 
sequence and the pre-Katangan basement. Stratigraphically, the sample is situated within the Ore Shale 
Formation at the base of the Upper Roan Subgroup. It is a biotite-tremolite-quartz schist with a 
porphyroblastic texture which also contains bornite and chalcopyrite. Retrograde metamorphism is 
reflected by biotite being replaced by chlorite. Step-heating 40Ar-39Ar was undertaken on a 0.47 mg 
population of biotite. Data are reported in a diagram of age versus %39Ar released (Fig. 4 and Table 1). 
The first apparent age, connected to a degassing temperature of 600ºC, is 469.5 ± 6.7 Ma and 
corresponds to 0.934% of the 39Ar released. The diagram presents two peaks at the temperatures 680ºC 
and 850ºC with apparent ages at 602.5 ± 2.8 Ma and 602.2 ± 2.3 Ma respectively. Between these older 
apparent ages and for 55.52% of the 39Ar released (equivalent to 5 consecutive increments), the 
apparent ages vary between 583.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 588.7 ± 1.5 Ma and yield a plateau age at 586.1 ± 1.7 
Ma with a MSWD at 1.4. The steps following the second peak, at 950ºC and 1050ºC show similar ages

Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/72, monazite  
 
Borehole RCB2 is 1840.68 m long and is located at the western limit of the Chambishi Southeast 
prospect (Fig. 2). It reaches the basal conglomerate of the Katangan sedimentary sequence. This 
sample was collected at a depth of 497 m and is stratigraphically situated in the Mwashya Subgroup. 
Sample RCB2/72 is from an iron formation interbedded with an altered tuff (biotite retrograded to 
chlorite, quartz and carbonate). Monazites are anhedral and green, intergrown with biotite or chlorite 
and clearly of metamorphic origin. Metamorphic monazites were analysed using the U-Pb SHRIMP 
technique. Data are reported in a Tera-Wasserburg diagram, Figure 5 and in Table 2. Analyses plot on 
a discordia intercepting the concordia curve. The weighted mean 206Pb/238U age is 592 ± 22 Ma, which 
is interpreted as the age of formation of these monazites.

Chambishi basin, sample NN75/26, biotite  
 
Borehole NN75 is located in the northeast area of the Chambishi basin, designated as the Southeast 
prospect (Fig. 2). It is 1033.78 m long, and penetrates the Katanga Supergroup to reach a granite that 
forms, together with the Lufubu schists, the local pre-Katangan basement (Rainaud et al., 2005). The 
sample NN75/26 was collected at a depth of 148 m, in a magnetite-rich iron-formation located 2 m 
below a tuffaceous layer in the Mwashya Subgroup. Between the grains of iron oxides, intergrowths of 
chlorite - biotite, calcite  and  quartz are developed.  A population of biotite crystals, weighing 1.00 mg

Figure 5.   Tera-Wasserburg diagram, sample RCB2/72 
 
was analysed by the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Data are reported in a diagram of age versus %39Ar released 
(Fig. 6; Table 3). This diagram presents a hump-shaped 40Ar-39Ar age profile. Apparent ages vary 
between 53.7 ± 1.0 Ma and 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma for temperatures between 650ºC and 970ºC. For 
temperatures between 1000ºC and 1100ºC, apparent ages vary between 614.7 ± 1.8 Ma and 554.4 ± 3.1 
Ma. No plateau age can be extracted and apparent ages are greater than the ones previously yielded by 
other samples.  
 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB1/36, monazite  
 
Borehole RCB1 is located 5 km west of RCB2 (Fig. 2) and is 1686.2 m deep. RCB1/36 was sampled at 
1284 m and is stratigraphically located in the Upper Roan Subgroup. This sample is a metapelite 
including biotite, quartz and K-feldspar. As seen previously in sample RCB272, monazites are green, 
anhedral and clearly metamorphic. They were extracted and analysed with the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique. Results are reported in Table 4 and presented in a Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram in 
Figure 7. Plots are clustered near the concordia and the weighted mean yields a 206Pb/238U age of 531 ± 
12 Ma. This age is interpreted as the age of formation of the monazites. 
 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/112, monazite  
 
Sample RCB2/112 was taken at a depth of 528 m, in the borehole RCB2. This sample is a marly 
dolomitic argillite from the Mwashya Subgroup. Monazites were analysed with the U-Pb SHRIMP 
dating technique. Data are reported in a Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram (Fig. 8; Table 5). 
Analyses plot in a cluster and yield weighted mean 206Pb/238U at 512 ± 17 Ma. This age is interpreted 
as the age of formation of these monazites.

Figure 8.   Tera-Wasserburg diagram, sample RCB2/112 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/112, biotite  
 
After obtaining the U-Pb SHRIMP age data on monazites (see above), a population of biotite grains 
weighing 0.83 mg was separated. The biotite grains were dated with the 40Ar-39Ar technique and the 
results are reported in Table 6 and the age data plotted in Figure 9. The first step at 650ºC yields a very 
young apparent age at 307.2 ± 2.6 Ma. The next two steps at 700ºC and 740ºC produce older ages of 
458.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 486.1 ± 1.5 Ma. The next seven steps, with temperatures between 760ºC and 
940ºC, yield apparent ages between 488.5 ± 1.5 Ma and 494.7 ±1.8 Ma. The extracted plateau age of 
this section is of 491.5 ± 1.6 Ma, with a MSWD = 1.7, and corresponds to 66.4% of the 39Ar released.  
The last section of the spectrum yields two older apparent ages (at 496.0 ± 1.2 Ma and 497.7 ± 1.4 Ma) 
and finally a much younger apparent age at 456.3 ± 8.1 Ma.

Figure 9.   Age vs. 39Ar released diagram, sample RCB2/112 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/4, biotite  
 
This sample is from the Lower Roan Subgroup and was collected at a depth of 1468 m from borehole 
RCB2. It is from a 0.5m thick biotite-bearing trough-crossbedded sandstone interbedded with 
conglomerates of the basal Roan Group. A population of biotite grains from this sample was analysed 
and the results are reported in Table 7, and plotted in Figure 10. The two first steps, at 650 ºC and 
700ºC, present apparent ages at 468.3 ± 3.6 Ma and 484.9 ± 1.6 Ma respectively. The following seven 
steps, for temperatures between 720ºC and 800 ºC, yield apparent ages ranging from 488.8 ± 1.7 Ma to 
493.4 ± 1.7 Ma. These seven apparent ages yield a plateau age at 490.9 ± 0.6 Ma with a MSWD = 1.2 
and with 75% of the 39Ar released. The following step at 850ºC presents a peak in the apparent ages at 
495.2 ± 1.8 Ma. The last three steps at 900, 1000 and 1200ºC yield apparent ages at, respectively, 
482.6 ± 2.9 Ma, 488.7 ± 2.0 Ma and 481.7 ± 5.3 Ma. 
 
Chambishi basin, sample MJZC9/25, biotite  
 
Borehole MJZC9 is located in the Chambishi basin, less than 1 km southwest of the borehole NN75 
(Figs. 1 and 2). This borehole is 1140 m deep and the sample MJZC9/25 came from a depth of 152 m. 
The sample is a laminated grey shale located in the Grand Conglomerat Formation, and comprises 
mainly quartz, sericite and biotite. A population of biotite crystals weighing 0.3 mg was separated and 
analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Results of analyses are reported in Table 8 and in an age 
spectrum (Fig. 11). The first two steps at 650ºC and 740ºC yield apparent ages at 393.1 ± 6.0 Ma and 
481.0 ± 1.3 Ma. The following five steps, between 760ºC and 880ºC, yield apparent ages ranging 
between 487.3 ± 4.1 and 483.0 ± 1.9 Ma and a plateau age at 485.2 Ma ± 0.9 Ma (with a MSWD at 
0.7) which corresponds to 62.4 % of the 39Ar released. The last part of the spectrum, from 950ºC to 
1100ºC, presents a convex shape with a peak of apparent age at 490.8 ± 1.8 Ma (at 950ºC). 
 
Chambishi basin, sample NN75/9, biotite 
 
Sample NN75/9 was taken at a depth of 893.6 m in borehole NN75, in the Chambishi Basin. It is 
located in the hangingwall of the orebody, in the Ore Shale Formation of the Upper Roan Subgroup. 
This sample is a rippled white dolarenite with specks of metamorphic biotite. A population of biotite

crystals weighing 0.44 mg was analysed. The results are reported in Table 9 and in an age versus 
%39Ar  released  diagram (Fig. 12).  The age spectrum presents  two young apparent ages (456.4 ± 13.1 
and 459.8 ± 6.0 Ma) at the first two temperature steps (600ºC and 680ºC). The following step at 720ºC 
yields an apparent age at 480.8 ± 3.6 Ma. Apparent ages from step 4 (at 760ºC) to step 12 (at 1300ºC) 
vary from 491.0 ± 1.6 Ma to 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma. These 9 steps yield, with 97.1% of 39Ar released, a 
plateau age at 488.0 ± 0.5 Ma with a MSWD at 1.5.

Nchanga, sample NCH1, biotite 
 
Sample NCH1 comes from the lower orebody from Nchanga Mine, in the so-called “Lower Banded 
Shale” or “LBS” unit, corresponding to the Orebody Formation of the basal Upper Roan Subgroup. It 
is a graphitic siltstone with quartz, K-feldspar, detrital muscovite and metamorphic biotite. A 
population of biotite crystals weighing 0.81 mg was analysed with the 40Ar/39Ar technique. Results of 
analyses are reported in an age versus %39Ar released diagram (Fig. 13) and in Table 10. The first step 
at 650ºC, yields a younger apparent age at 435.3 ± 2.7 Ma. The steps at 1060ºC and at 1120ºC were 
lost during manipulation. Steps before and after the loss are similar, within error at 487.7 ± 1.3 Ma and 
489.3 ± 3.1 Ma.

Figure 13.  Age vs. 39Ar released diagram, sample NCH1 
Konkola, sample KN1A, biotite and muscovite  
 
Sample KN1A comes from the Konkola area, northern Zambia. Stratigraphically, it is located in the 
Lower Roan Subgroup. The sample is a greenish siltstone containing mainly quartz, biotite and 
muscovite with minor K-feldspar. Analyses of 40Ar-39Ar were done on a population of biotite grains, as 
well as on a separate population of muscovite grains from the same sample.  
 
• Biotite: Results of analyses of a biotite population weighing 0.38 mg are reported in Figure 14 
and Table 11. The first step at 600°C yielded a young apparent age at 181.6 ± 5.2 Ma 
(corresponding to 1.57% of 39Ar released). The second apparent age, at 700°C, is older, at 
483.7 ± 1.7 Ma (corresponding to 12.68% of the 39Ar released). The five following steps, for 
temperatures between 740°C and 850°C, give a plateau age at 496.6 ± 0.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.45, 
61.5% of 39Ar released) and apparent ages varying between 497.3 ± 1.3 Ma and 494.0 ± 2.1 
Ma. The two next steps at temperatures of 920°C and 1100°C yield older apparent ages at 503.2 
± 3.2 Ma and 515.1 ± 2.1 Ma respectively (for a total of 24.0% of 39Ar released). Finally the 
last step, at 1300°C, yielded a younger apparent age at 342.7 ± 47.7 Ma but corresponds to only 
0.22% of the 39Ar released. 
 
• Muscovite: A population of muscovite crystals weighing 0.58 mg was analysed. Results are 
reported in an age spectrum diagram (Fig. 15) and in Table 12. The first step at 700°C, with 
5.45% of 39Ar released, yielded an apparent age of 415.1 ± 2.3 Ma. The second step, at 800°C 
shows a sudden increase of the apparent age at 515.8 ± 1.6 Ma. The third step at 850 °C yielded 
a younger apparent age than at the previous step, with 489.8 ± 0.7 Ma. From the fourth step (at 
900°C) to the eighth step (at 1050°C), the spectrum presents a plateau age at 483.6 ± 1.1 Ma, 
MSWD = 2.1, corresponding to 69.4% of the 39Ar released with apparent ages varying from 
485.4 ± 1.3 Ma to 481.5 ± 1.0 Ma.

Musoshi (DRC), sample MUS 1, microcline 
 
Sample MUS1 comes from the Musoshi Mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is an arkose 
which was located in the Musoshi Formation of the Lower Roan Subgroup, which forms a part of the 
footwall of the orebody in the Musoshi area. A population of microcline grains, weighing 0.81 mg, was 
separated and analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Results are reported in Table 13 and in an age 
spectrum, age versus 39Ar released diagram (Fig. 16). Apparent ages vary between 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma and 
467.0 ± 2.7 Ma.

DISCUSSION 
 
The deposition of the Katangan sequence started somewhere after 877 Ma (Armstrong et al., 2004) and 
finished sometime after 573 ± 5 Ma (Master et al., 2005). Following deposition, the Katangan 
sedimentary sequence underwent several episodes of metamorphism during the late Neoproterozoic 
Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny, which gave the Copperbelt its arcuate shape (Cahen et al., 1984; Cosi 
et al., 1992).

Geochronology 
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses of all biotite, muscovite and microcline samples yielded degassing patterns with 
well-known features. All the samples showed very young apparent ages associated with low 
temperatures of degassing. These young apparent ages can be related to the release of the argon located 
in the external, least retentive sites of the minerals. The energy necessary to release the argon in these 
sites is minimal and the slightest thermal disturbance could produce a loss of argon (Hanes, 1991). A 
common feature in biotite degassing patterns is the presence of two peaks in the apparent ages at 
680°C and 850°C. The first peak at around 650°C represents released argon related to a stage of 
dehydroxylation of the biotite, while the second peak at 850°C can be related to one phase of 
dehydroxylation of chlorite (Lo and Onstott, 1989). 
 
The justification for using two methods of analyses lies in the difference between their closure 
temperatures. For the biotite and muscovite and in the case of 40Ar-39Ar analyses, closure temperatures 
are between 300-400°C. For monazite in U-Pb analyses, Parrish (1990) evaluated the closure 
temperature at 725 ± 25 °C, while more recent studies (Cherniak et al., 2002) estimate it at more than 
900 °C. Hence, ages obtained for analyses on monazite give the age of crystallisation of these minerals 
or the age of a metamorphic event in the case of overgrowths. As seen in the samples analysed, 
monazites commonly do not lie on the Concordia curve. This behaviour is attributed to the presence of 
excess 206Pb formed by the initial incorporation of 230Th (Heaman and Parrish, 1991). Ages obtained 
using the 40Ar-39Ar technique are not as straightforward to interpret. While a plateau age gives the age 
of a metamorphic event, in general, ages produced with the 40Ar-39Ar technique commonly generate 
problems of interpretation.  
 
In this study, ten populations of biotite, muscovite and microcline grains were analysed using the 40Ar-
39Ar technique. Out of these ten samples, three (NN75/26, NCH1 and MUS1) do not yield plateau ages 
as defined by MacDougall (1999). In this section we discuss the provisos related to the interpretation 
of these three samples. Sample NN75/26, which was collected from an iron-formation located 2 m 
below a tuffaceous layer, yielded a hump-shaped curve on an age vs %39Ar released diagram, with 
apparent ages ranging from 53.7 ± 1.0 Ma to 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma, which implies a thermal disturbance of

22
the system (Lo and Onstott, 1989; Di Vicenzo et al., 2003). The maximum apparent ages of this 
sample are significantly older than ages yielded by other samples from this area and from this drill 
hole. The 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma apparent age is the highest recorded during this study but is difficult to 
interpret because it occurs without the presence of a plateau age. Still, this age can be found elsewhere 
in the Lufilian Arc (Cosi et al., 1992). One plausible explanation for the disturbed age spectrum 
yielded by the sample NN75/26 is the incorporation of an excess of argon in the biotite. It is difficult to 
pin-point the cause of this excess. The emplacement of the tuffaceous layer below which the sample 
was extracted cannot explain this argon excess. The temperatures involved were too low and the 
thermal effects on the surrounding rocks were minimal. Although the biotite was separated with 
extreme care in order to obtain pristine biotite, it is possible that some chloritised biotite may have 
been included in the analysed population of grains. The excess of argon may then have been associated 
with the chlorite (Lo and Onstott, 1989). Problems with the sample NCH1 from Nchanga Mine were 
purely technical and induced a partial loss of argon. It should be noted that the apparent age before the 
loss, 487.7 ± 1.3 Ma, is similar within error, to the apparent age following the lost step due to the 
technical problem, at 489.3 ± 3.1 Ma. Finally, microclines (from sample MUS1) were also analysed 
with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. This sample does not yield a plateau age but instead shows gradually 
increasing apparent ages between 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma and 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma. It is not uncommon to find these 
age spectra for potassium feldspars. These minerals do not have one closure temperature but a range of 
closure temperatures ranging from 350°C to 125°C (Foland, 1974; Purdy and Jäger, 1976; Harrison 
and McDougall, 1982; Lovera et al., 1989). A spectrum without a plateau age may imply a slow 
cooling, but it is difficult to quantify the rate at which it occurs without a complete 40Ar-39Ar study of 
K-feldspars from the area.

In the present study, Ar-Ar and U-Pb SHRIMP analyses were performed on several samples collected 
from a stratigraphic succession extending from the Lower Roan Subgroup to the Grand Conglomerat 
Formation. A summary of the ages obtained in this study is given in Table 14. The ages obtained do 
not represent a continuum but rather several distinct groupings. Three samples yielded ages between 
631.8 ± 1.8 and 592 ± 22 Ma. This age span is recorded in other parts of the Central African 
Copperbelt and in the Irumide Belt. In central Zambia a phase of eclogite facies metamorphism was 
dated at 595 ± 10 Ma, based on a Sm-Nd age on garnet and whole rock in eclogite (John et al., 2003). 
In the Zambian Copperbelt, Re-Os analyses on rocks from the Nkana, Chibuluma and Nchanga 
deposits yielded an isochron age of 583 ± 24 Ma (Barra et al., 2004). A similar, but reset, Rb-Sr age of 
582 ± 40 Ma was obtained (Cahen et al., 1984) for the Kafue Rhyolite, which has a U-Pb zircon age of 
c. 879 Ma (Hanson et al., 1994). U-Th-Pb analyses on monazites from the Luiswishi Cu-Co-U deposits 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo gave ages between 603 ± 31 Ma and 556 ± 29 Ma (Lerouge et 
al., 2004). The age of 531 ± 12 Ma obtained in this study with the U-Pb technique on metamorphic 
monazites from the Chambishi basin is similar to others found elsewhere in the Lufilian arc and the 
Zambezi Belt. Monazite from a biotite-kyanite-garnet gneiss showed an U-Pb age of 529 ± 2 Ma while 
the same minerals from some whiteschists yielded 207Pb/235U ages of 531 to 532 ± 2 Ma (John et al., 
2004). Molybdenite from the Nkana deposit yielded an age of 525.7 ± 3.4 Ma with the Re-Os 
technique (Barra et al., 2004). In central Zambia, an unfolded rhyolite in the Katangan sedimentary 
sequence was dated with the U-Pb zircon leaching technique at 538.0 ± 1.5 Ma (Hanson et al., 1993). 
Recent U-Th-Pb analyses on monazites of sediments from the Luiswishi deposit yielded an age of 556 
± 29 Ma (Lerouge et al., 2004). Analyses on monazites and rutiles from the Kalumbila deposit in 
northwest Zambia yielded U-Pb ages of 548.6 ± 7.6 Ma and 531 ± 21 Ma respectively (Steven and 
Armstrong, 2003). The age of 512 ± 17 Ma, obtained from the last set of analysed monazites 
(RCB1/36), was also found elsewhere in the Copperbelt. Richards et al. (1988a, b) analysed rutiles and 
uraninites associated with veining crosscutting the ore body of the Musoshi deposit. The ages for rutile 
and uraninite are identical with 514 ± 2 Ma and 514 ± 3 Ma. More recently, Re-Os and U-Pb analyses 
of respectively molybdenite and monazite yielded ages of 511.8 ± 1.7 Ma (molybdenite), 512.9 ± 1.7 
Ma  (molybdenite) and 509 ± 11 Ma (monazite) (Torrealday et al., 2000).  
 
The last and largest set of samples yielded the youngest age range, between 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma and 496.6 
± 0.6 Ma. Similar ages are widely recorded in the Copperbelt and adjacent areas. In the Domes area, 
west of the Zambian Copperbelt, Cosi et al. (1992) obtained a large set of K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages 
ranging from 475 ± 6 Ma to 492 ± 6 Ma. Furthermore, Cahen and Snelling (1971) obtained a K-Ar age 
of 483 ± 15 Ma for lavas located in the Kibambale area as well as K-Ar biotite ages from Nkana, 
Nchanga and Kinsenda ranging between 495 and 422 Ma.  
 
Regional implications 
 
During the Neoproterozoic, at c. 750–730 Ma, the southern part of the Congo Craton underwent rifting 
during the opening of the Khomas ocean (Hoffman, 1994). Damaran and Katangan sedimentary rocks 
were deposited in the resulting passive margin (Porada and Berhorst, 2000). During the Pan-African 
Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, the Khomas ocean closed with subduction of oceanic lithosphere 
underneath the Congo Craton margin, leading to the formation of an Andean-type magmatic arc, and 
ultimately to the Himalayan-type collision between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons at about 550-510 
Ma (Miller, 1983; Porada and Berhorst, 2000). Eclogite facies metamorphism from the Zambezi Belt, 
dated at 595 ± 10 Ma, and comprising associated gabbros, metagabbros and eclogite, records the 
timing of the subduction, which took place in an oceanic environment (John et al., 2003).

The ages of c. 590 Ma recorded by both the U-Pb system in monazite, and the 40Ar-39Ar system in 
biotite in the present study show that there was some tectonic activity with attendant metamorphism in 
the Chambishi Basin that was coeval with the eclogite facies metamorphism recorded in the Zambezi 
Belt. The temperatures during this first metamorphic event were higher than during subsequent events, 
as recorded by the epidote-amphibolite facies assemblages at Muliashi. Talc-kyanite whiteschists in the 
Lufilian Arc, dated at c. 530 Ma, represent the final stage of collision between the Congo and the 
Kalahari Cratons (John et al., 2004). Our monazite age of 531 ± 12 Ma is probably related to this 
event. The ages at c. 512 Ma recorded in the Katangan basin are clearly related to a widespread 
mineralising phase (molybdenite, monazite, rutile, uraninite) due to circulation of fluids (Richards et 
al., 1988a,b; Torrealday et al., 2000). The range of 40Ar-39Ar mica ages at c. 492–406 Ma may be 
related to post-orogenic regional uplift and cooling which affected the whole Katangan basin. The 
youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 ± 2.7 
Ma to 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma. This age range encompasses a muscovite Rb-Sr age of 450 ± 9 Ma from 
Malundwe in the Mwombezhi Dome (Cosi et al., 1992). This young metamorphic event corresponds to 
the age (458–427 Ma) of the late nepheline-syenite Mukumbi intrusion north of the Mwombezhi Dome 
(Cosi et al., 1992). Young intrusions of an age similar to the Mukumbi nepheline-syenite have not 
been reported from the Copperbelt region, thus it is likely that the youngest ages recorded by the 
microclines at Musoshi are a reflection of continued post-orogenic uplift and slow cooling of the 
Lufilian orogen.

MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF 
METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING 
THE PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY 
 
ABSTRACT 
New SHRIMP U-Pb age data on metamorphic monazite, as well as step-heating 40Ar-39Ar 
ages on metamorphic biotite, muscovite and microcline, from Katangan metasedimentary 
rocks of the Central African Copperbelt are presented. These rocks were deformed and 
metamorphosed during the Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny. Three samples of metamorphic 
monazite from the Chambishi structural basin give ages of 592 ± 22 Ma, 531 ± 12 Ma and 
512 ± 17 Ma, which correspond respectively to the ages of eclogite facies metamorphism, 
high pressure talc-kyanite whiteschist metamorphism, and of a regional metamorphism/ 
mineralisation pulse elsewhere within the Lufilian Orogen. A biotite population from 
Luanshya gives a 40Ar/39Ar plateau age of 586.1 ± 1.7 Ma, coinciding with the oldest 
monazite age. Several samples from the Chambishi basin and the Konkola area give 40Ar/39Ar 
biotite plateau ages in the range of 496.6 ± 0.6 to 485.2 ±  0.9 Ma, and a muscovite plateau 
age of 483.6 ± 1.1 Ma, which are a manifestation of regional uplift and cooling that affected 
the whole Katangan basin. The youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from 
microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma to 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma, reflecting continued 
slow cooling of the Lufilian Orogen.

 MONAZITE U-PB DATING AND 40AR-39AR THERMOCHRONOLOGY OF 
METAMORPHIC EVENTS IN THE CENTRAL AFRICAN COPPERBELT DURING THE 
PAN-AFRICAN LUFILIAN OROGENY 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
This paper is part of a wider geochronological study of the Central African Copperbelt and its 
basement. After constraining the nature and evolution of the basement of the Copperbelt (Rainaud et 
al. 2003, 2005), and the provenance of key units within the Katanga Supergroup and their ages (Master 
et al., 2005), in this paper we provide new data dealing with the several metamorphic episodes which 
occurred in the Central African Copperbelt during the Lufilian Orogeny, and discuss their implications 
for the evolution of the Katangan basin 
 
REGIONAL SETTING 
 
The Katanga Supergroup is the host of the major stratiform sediment-hosted Cu-Co deposits, as well as 
numerous other deposits of Cu, Pb, Zn, U, Au, Fe etc., which constitute the Central African Copperbelt 
in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This succession is a Neoproterozoic 
metasedimentary sequence which consists of the Roan Group, the Nguba Group, the Fungurume and 
the Biano Groups (Wendorff, 2001a,b; 2002a,b; 2003a,b; Cailteux, 2003). The lowermost Roan Group 
was deposited after c. 880 Ma (Armstrong et al., 1999), and is subdivided into the mainly siliciclastic 
Lower Roan Subgroup, and the mainly dolomitic and evaporitic Upper Roan Subgroup (Master et al., 
2005). The base of the Nguba Group, the Mwashya Subgroup, was deposited at around 765 Ma (Key et 
al., 2001), while porphyritic lavas attributed to the upper part of the Nguba Group were dated at 735 
Ma (Armstrong, 2000; Liyungu et al., 2001; Key et al., 2001). The Mwashya Subgroup is overlain by 
the Grand Conglomerat Member, which is a glacial tillite (Master et al., 2005). Finally, the Fungurume 
and Biano Groups were deposited syntectonically in a foreland basin during the Lufilian Orogeny, after 
c. 572 Ma (Wendorff, 2003a; Master et al., 2005).  
 
The Katanga Supergroup was deformed and metamorphosed during the Pan-African Zambezi and 
Lufilian orogenies (Porada and Berhorst, 2000), at between 600 and 480 Ma. Metamorphism in the 
Zambian Copperbelt was mainly of greenschist facies, except at Muliashi, where epidote-amphibolite 
facies assemblages were recognised, characterised by the presence of tremolite, biotite, epidote and 
actinolite in impure dolomites, and of scapolite and clinozoisite in argillites (Mendelsohn, 1961). In the 
Domes area to the west of the Copperbelt, amphibolite facies assemblages are recognised (Cosi et al., 
1992). A large number of imprecise U-Pb, Rb-Sr and K-Ar age data from the Lufilian Arc and 
Zambezi Belt, spanning the time period 500 ± 100 Ma are summarised by Cahen et al. (1984). More 
recently, the Kipushi deposit was dated at 454 Ma (Walraven and Chabu, 1994) but was also 
recalculated at 750 Ma using a three-stage model (Kampunzu et al., 1998). In the Musoshi district, U-
Pb analyses on uraninite and rutile yielded ages of c. 514 Ma (Richards et al., 1988a, b). Molybdenite 
from Kansanshi (Zambia) yielded ages of c. 512 and 502 Ma with the Re-Os technique (Torrealday et 
al., 2000). Eclogites from Central Zambia yielded a Sm-Nd isochron at 595 ± 10 Ma (John et al., 2003) 
while a phase of high-pressure whiteschist metamorphism yielded a U-Pb monazite age of 529 ± 2 Ma 
(John et al., 2004). 
 
ANALYTICAL METHODS 
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses were performed at the Research School of Earth Sciences (RSES), Australian 
National University, Canberra. Muscovites were separated at the the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory,

University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples were reduced in a jaw crusher 
and through a pulverizer into a coarse powder which was then sieved. Extracts were purified at the 
Australian National University, using conventional magnetic separation and heavy liquid techniques. 
The resulting separates were of ~99% or higher purity. The 40Ar/39Ar dating technique used was 
described in detail by McDougall and Harrison (1999). Crystals were placed into an aluminium 
irradiation canister together with interspersed aliquots of the flux monitor GA 1550 (age = 98.5 Ma; 
Spell and McDougall, 2003). Packets containing degassed potassium glass were placed at either end of 
the canister to monitor the 40Ar production from potassium (e.g. Tetley, 1980). The irradiation canister 
was irradiated for 504 hours in position X34 of the ANSTO, HIFAR reactor, Lucas Heights, New 
South Wales, Australia. The canister, which was lined with 0.2 mm Cd to absorb thermal neutrons, was 
inverted three times during the irradiation, which reduced neutron flux gradients to < 2% along the 
length of the canister. Mass discrimination was monitored by analyses of standard air volumes. 
Correction factors for interfering reactions are as follows: (40Ar/39Ar)Ca = 3.50(± 0.14)x10-4; 
(39Ar/37Ar)Ca = 7.86(± 0.01)x10-4 (McDougall and Harrison, 1999); (40Ar/39Ar)K = 0.050 (± 0.005). 
K/Ca ratios were determined from the ANU laboratory hornblende standard 77-600 and were 
calculated as follows: K/Ca = 1.9 x 39Ar/37Ar. The reported data have been corrected for system 
blanks, mass discrimination and radioactive decay. The calculated ages have been corrected 
additionally for reactor interferences, fluence gradients and atmospheric contamination. Errors 
associated with the age determinations are one sigma uncertainties and include errors in the J-value 
estimates. The error on the J-value is ± 0.35 %, excluding the uncertainty in the age of GA1550 (which 
is ~ 1%). Decay constants are those of Steiger and Jäger (1977). 
 
Plateau portions of the age spectra are defined as comprising at least three contiguous increments, with 
concordant ages (i.e. ages that are within two sigma of the mean age). In addition, this segment should 
contain a significant proportion of the total 39Ar released (MacDougall, 1999).  
 
U-Pb analyses were performed on the SHRIMP II ion microprobe at the Australian National 
University, Canberra. The separation of monazites was carried out at the Hugh Allsopp Laboratory, 
Johannesburg, using a Wilfley Table, a Frantz Isodynamic Magnetic Separator, and heavy liquids. The 
SHRIMP analytical procedure used in this study is similar to that described by Claoué-Long et al. 
(1995). Age calculations and plotting were done using Isoplot/Ex (Ludwig, 2000). 
 
SAMPLING 
 
Eleven samples were utilised for the purpose of this study (Fig. 1): seven were located in the 
Chambishi basin in Zambia (Fig. 2), one in the Konkola area (also in Zambia), one in the Muliashi 
South deposit (Zambia, near Luanshya), one in the Nchanga mine (Zambia) and finally, one in the 
Musoshi Mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Fig. 1). Two of these samples were dated by two 
methods. 
 
In one sample (sample RCB2/112), monazites were extracted and dated with the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique while a population of biotite crystals was analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. With the 
sample KN1A (from the Konkola area) muscovite and biotite crystal populations were dated with the 
40Ar-39Ar dating technique. Monazites from three samples collected in the Chambishi basin were 
analysed using the SHRIMP U-Pb technique. Biotite from six samples and microclines from one 
sample were analysed using the 40Ar-39Ar technique. All samples are derived from the Lower Roan 
Subgroup up to the Grand Conglomerat Formation (Fig. 3).

RESULTS 
 
Samples analysed and dated in this study yielded several distinct age ranges. Three samples give an 
age range between 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma and 586.1 ± 1.7 Ma, 6 samples give an age range between 496.6 ± 
0.6 Ma and 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma while individual samples give ages of 531 ± 12 Ma and 512 ± 17 Ma. 
 
Muliashi South deposit (Luanshya), sample BH89/3, biotite 
 
Borehole BH89 is located on the southern flank of the Roan Antelope synclinorium and more precisely 
on the Muliashi South deposit (Fig. 1) where reserves are estimated at 22 Mt grading at 2.32% Cu 
(Mbendi, 2002). This bore hole is 975.36 m deep and reaches the pre-Katangan basement. Sample 
BH89/3 is located 743 m below the surface and at 35 m above the contact between the sedimentary 
sequence and the pre-Katangan basement. Stratigraphically, the sample is situated within the Ore Shale 
Formation at the base of the Upper Roan Subgroup. It is a biotite-tremolite-quartz schist with a 
porphyroblastic texture which also contains bornite and chalcopyrite. Retrograde metamorphism is 
reflected by biotite being replaced by chlorite. Step-heating 40Ar-39Ar was undertaken on a 0.47 mg 
population of biotite. Data are reported in a diagram of age versus %39Ar released (Fig. 4 and Table 1). 
The first apparent age, connected to a degassing temperature of 600ºC, is 469.5 ± 6.7 Ma and 
corresponds to 0.934% of the 39Ar released. The diagram presents two peaks at the temperatures 680ºC 
and 850ºC with apparent ages at 602.5 ± 2.8 Ma and 602.2 ± 2.3 Ma respectively. Between these older 
apparent ages and for 55.52% of the 39Ar released (equivalent to 5 consecutive increments), the 
apparent ages vary between 583.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 588.7 ± 1.5 Ma and yield a plateau age at 586.1 ± 1.7 
Ma with a MSWD at 1.4. The steps following the second peak, at 950ºC and 1050ºC show similar ages

Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/72, monazite  
 
Borehole RCB2 is 1840.68 m long and is located at the western limit of the Chambishi Southeast 
prospect (Fig. 2). It reaches the basal conglomerate of the Katangan sedimentary sequence. This 
sample was collected at a depth of 497 m and is stratigraphically situated in the Mwashya Subgroup. 
Sample RCB2/72 is from an iron formation interbedded with an altered tuff (biotite retrograded to 
chlorite, quartz and carbonate). Monazites are anhedral and green, intergrown with biotite or chlorite 
and clearly of metamorphic origin. Metamorphic monazites were analysed using the U-Pb SHRIMP 
technique. Data are reported in a Tera-Wasserburg diagram, Figure 5 and in Table 2. Analyses plot on 
a discordia intercepting the concordia curve. The weighted mean 206Pb/238U age is 592 ± 22 Ma, which 
is interpreted as the age of formation of these monazites.

Chambishi basin, sample NN75/26, biotite  
 
Borehole NN75 is located in the northeast area of the Chambishi basin, designated as the Southeast 
prospect (Fig. 2). It is 1033.78 m long, and penetrates the Katanga Supergroup to reach a granite that 
forms, together with the Lufubu schists, the local pre-Katangan basement (Rainaud et al., 2005). The 
sample NN75/26 was collected at a depth of 148 m, in a magnetite-rich iron-formation located 2 m 
below a tuffaceous layer in the Mwashya Subgroup. Between the grains of iron oxides, intergrowths of 
chlorite - biotite, calcite  and  quartz are developed.  A population of biotite crystals, weighing 1.00 mg

Figure 5.   Tera-Wasserburg diagram, sample RCB2/72 
 
was analysed by the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Data are reported in a diagram of age versus %39Ar released 
(Fig. 6; Table 3). This diagram presents a hump-shaped 40Ar-39Ar age profile. Apparent ages vary 
between 53.7 ± 1.0 Ma and 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma for temperatures between 650ºC and 970ºC. For 
temperatures between 1000ºC and 1100ºC, apparent ages vary between 614.7 ± 1.8 Ma and 554.4 ± 3.1 
Ma. No plateau age can be extracted and apparent ages are greater than the ones previously yielded by 
other samples.  
 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB1/36, monazite  
 
Borehole RCB1 is located 5 km west of RCB2 (Fig. 2) and is 1686.2 m deep. RCB1/36 was sampled at 
1284 m and is stratigraphically located in the Upper Roan Subgroup. This sample is a metapelite 
including biotite, quartz and K-feldspar. As seen previously in sample RCB272, monazites are green, 
anhedral and clearly metamorphic. They were extracted and analysed with the SHRIMP U-Pb 
technique. Results are reported in Table 4 and presented in a Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram in 
Figure 7. Plots are clustered near the concordia and the weighted mean yields a 206Pb/238U age of 531 ± 
12 Ma. This age is interpreted as the age of formation of the monazites. 
 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/112, monazite  
 
Sample RCB2/112 was taken at a depth of 528 m, in the borehole RCB2. This sample is a marly 
dolomitic argillite from the Mwashya Subgroup. Monazites were analysed with the U-Pb SHRIMP 
dating technique. Data are reported in a Tera-Wasserburg concordia diagram (Fig. 8; Table 5). 
Analyses plot in a cluster and yield weighted mean 206Pb/238U at 512 ± 17 Ma. This age is interpreted 
as the age of formation of these monazites.

Figure 8.   Tera-Wasserburg diagram, sample RCB2/112 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/112, biotite  
 
After obtaining the U-Pb SHRIMP age data on monazites (see above), a population of biotite grains 
weighing 0.83 mg was separated. The biotite grains were dated with the 40Ar-39Ar technique and the 
results are reported in Table 6 and the age data plotted in Figure 9. The first step at 650ºC yields a very 
young apparent age at 307.2 ± 2.6 Ma. The next two steps at 700ºC and 740ºC produce older ages of 
458.3 ± 1.8 Ma and 486.1 ± 1.5 Ma. The next seven steps, with temperatures between 760ºC and 
940ºC, yield apparent ages between 488.5 ± 1.5 Ma and 494.7 ±1.8 Ma. The extracted plateau age of 
this section is of 491.5 ± 1.6 Ma, with a MSWD = 1.7, and corresponds to 66.4% of the 39Ar released.  
The last section of the spectrum yields two older apparent ages (at 496.0 ± 1.2 Ma and 497.7 ± 1.4 Ma) 
and finally a much younger apparent age at 456.3 ± 8.1 Ma.

Figure 9.   Age vs. 39Ar released diagram, sample RCB2/112 
Chambishi basin, sample RCB2/4, biotite  
 
This sample is from the Lower Roan Subgroup and was collected at a depth of 1468 m from borehole 
RCB2. It is from a 0.5m thick biotite-bearing trough-crossbedded sandstone interbedded with 
conglomerates of the basal Roan Group. A population of biotite grains from this sample was analysed 
and the results are reported in Table 7, and plotted in Figure 10. The two first steps, at 650 ºC and 
700ºC, present apparent ages at 468.3 ± 3.6 Ma and 484.9 ± 1.6 Ma respectively. The following seven 
steps, for temperatures between 720ºC and 800 ºC, yield apparent ages ranging from 488.8 ± 1.7 Ma to 
493.4 ± 1.7 Ma. These seven apparent ages yield a plateau age at 490.9 ± 0.6 Ma with a MSWD = 1.2 
and with 75% of the 39Ar released. The following step at 850ºC presents a peak in the apparent ages at 
495.2 ± 1.8 Ma. The last three steps at 900, 1000 and 1200ºC yield apparent ages at, respectively, 
482.6 ± 2.9 Ma, 488.7 ± 2.0 Ma and 481.7 ± 5.3 Ma. 
 
Chambishi basin, sample MJZC9/25, biotite  
 
Borehole MJZC9 is located in the Chambishi basin, less than 1 km southwest of the borehole NN75 
(Figs. 1 and 2). This borehole is 1140 m deep and the sample MJZC9/25 came from a depth of 152 m. 
The sample is a laminated grey shale located in the Grand Conglomerat Formation, and comprises 
mainly quartz, sericite and biotite. A population of biotite crystals weighing 0.3 mg was separated and 
analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Results of analyses are reported in Table 8 and in an age 
spectrum (Fig. 11). The first two steps at 650ºC and 740ºC yield apparent ages at 393.1 ± 6.0 Ma and 
481.0 ± 1.3 Ma. The following five steps, between 760ºC and 880ºC, yield apparent ages ranging 
between 487.3 ± 4.1 and 483.0 ± 1.9 Ma and a plateau age at 485.2 Ma ± 0.9 Ma (with a MSWD at 
0.7) which corresponds to 62.4 % of the 39Ar released. The last part of the spectrum, from 950ºC to 
1100ºC, presents a convex shape with a peak of apparent age at 490.8 ± 1.8 Ma (at 950ºC). 
 
Chambishi basin, sample NN75/9, biotite 
 
Sample NN75/9 was taken at a depth of 893.6 m in borehole NN75, in the Chambishi Basin. It is 
located in the hangingwall of the orebody, in the Ore Shale Formation of the Upper Roan Subgroup. 
This sample is a rippled white dolarenite with specks of metamorphic biotite. A population of biotite

crystals weighing 0.44 mg was analysed. The results are reported in Table 9 and in an age versus 
%39Ar  released  diagram (Fig. 12).  The age spectrum presents  two young apparent ages (456.4 ± 13.1 
and 459.8 ± 6.0 Ma) at the first two temperature steps (600ºC and 680ºC). The following step at 720ºC 
yields an apparent age at 480.8 ± 3.6 Ma. Apparent ages from step 4 (at 760ºC) to step 12 (at 1300ºC) 
vary from 491.0 ± 1.6 Ma to 485.4 ± 1.9 Ma. These 9 steps yield, with 97.1% of 39Ar released, a 
plateau age at 488.0 ± 0.5 Ma with a MSWD at 1.5.

Nchanga, sample NCH1, biotite 
 
Sample NCH1 comes from the lower orebody from Nchanga Mine, in the so-called “Lower Banded 
Shale” or “LBS” unit, corresponding to the Orebody Formation of the basal Upper Roan Subgroup. It 
is a graphitic siltstone with quartz, K-feldspar, detrital muscovite and metamorphic biotite. A 
population of biotite crystals weighing 0.81 mg was analysed with the 40Ar/39Ar technique. Results of 
analyses are reported in an age versus %39Ar released diagram (Fig. 13) and in Table 10. The first step 
at 650ºC, yields a younger apparent age at 435.3 ± 2.7 Ma. The steps at 1060ºC and at 1120ºC were 
lost during manipulation. Steps before and after the loss are similar, within error at 487.7 ± 1.3 Ma and 
489.3 ± 3.1 Ma.

Figure 13.  Age vs. 39Ar released diagram, sample NCH1 
Konkola, sample KN1A, biotite and muscovite  
 
Sample KN1A comes from the Konkola area, northern Zambia. Stratigraphically, it is located in the 
Lower Roan Subgroup. The sample is a greenish siltstone containing mainly quartz, biotite and 
muscovite with minor K-feldspar. Analyses of 40Ar-39Ar were done on a population of biotite grains, as 
well as on a separate population of muscovite grains from the same sample.  
 
• Biotite: Results of analyses of a biotite population weighing 0.38 mg are reported in Figure 14 
and Table 11. The first step at 600°C yielded a young apparent age at 181.6 ± 5.2 Ma 
(corresponding to 1.57% of 39Ar released). The second apparent age, at 700°C, is older, at 
483.7 ± 1.7 Ma (corresponding to 12.68% of the 39Ar released). The five following steps, for 
temperatures between 740°C and 850°C, give a plateau age at 496.6 ± 0.6 Ma (MSWD = 0.45, 
61.5% of 39Ar released) and apparent ages varying between 497.3 ± 1.3 Ma and 494.0 ± 2.1 
Ma. The two next steps at temperatures of 920°C and 1100°C yield older apparent ages at 503.2 
± 3.2 Ma and 515.1 ± 2.1 Ma respectively (for a total of 24.0% of 39Ar released). Finally the 
last step, at 1300°C, yielded a younger apparent age at 342.7 ± 47.7 Ma but corresponds to only 
0.22% of the 39Ar released. 
 
• Muscovite: A population of muscovite crystals weighing 0.58 mg was analysed. Results are 
reported in an age spectrum diagram (Fig. 15) and in Table 12. The first step at 700°C, with 
5.45% of 39Ar released, yielded an apparent age of 415.1 ± 2.3 Ma. The second step, at 800°C 
shows a sudden increase of the apparent age at 515.8 ± 1.6 Ma. The third step at 850 °C yielded 
a younger apparent age than at the previous step, with 489.8 ± 0.7 Ma. From the fourth step (at 
900°C) to the eighth step (at 1050°C), the spectrum presents a plateau age at 483.6 ± 1.1 Ma, 
MSWD = 2.1, corresponding to 69.4% of the 39Ar released with apparent ages varying from 
485.4 ± 1.3 Ma to 481.5 ± 1.0 Ma.

Musoshi (DRC), sample MUS 1, microcline 
 
Sample MUS1 comes from the Musoshi Mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is an arkose 
which was located in the Musoshi Formation of the Lower Roan Subgroup, which forms a part of the 
footwall of the orebody in the Musoshi area. A population of microcline grains, weighing 0.81 mg, was 
separated and analysed with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. Results are reported in Table 13 and in an age 
spectrum, age versus 39Ar released diagram (Fig. 16). Apparent ages vary between 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma and 
467.0 ± 2.7 Ma.

DISCUSSION 
 
The deposition of the Katangan sequence started somewhere after 877 Ma (Armstrong et al., 2004) and 
finished sometime after 573 ± 5 Ma (Master et al., 2005). Following deposition, the Katangan 
sedimentary sequence underwent several episodes of metamorphism during the late Neoproterozoic 
Pan-African Lufilian Orogeny, which gave the Copperbelt its arcuate shape (Cahen et al., 1984; Cosi 
et al., 1992).

Geochronology 
 
40Ar-39Ar analyses of all biotite, muscovite and microcline samples yielded degassing patterns with 
well-known features. All the samples showed very young apparent ages associated with low 
temperatures of degassing. These young apparent ages can be related to the release of the argon located 
in the external, least retentive sites of the minerals. The energy necessary to release the argon in these 
sites is minimal and the slightest thermal disturbance could produce a loss of argon (Hanes, 1991). A 
common feature in biotite degassing patterns is the presence of two peaks in the apparent ages at 
680°C and 850°C. The first peak at around 650°C represents released argon related to a stage of 
dehydroxylation of the biotite, while the second peak at 850°C can be related to one phase of 
dehydroxylation of chlorite (Lo and Onstott, 1989). 
 
The justification for using two methods of analyses lies in the difference between their closure 
temperatures. For the biotite and muscovite and in the case of 40Ar-39Ar analyses, closure temperatures 
are between 300-400°C. For monazite in U-Pb analyses, Parrish (1990) evaluated the closure 
temperature at 725 ± 25 °C, while more recent studies (Cherniak et al., 2002) estimate it at more than 
900 °C. Hence, ages obtained for analyses on monazite give the age of crystallisation of these minerals 
or the age of a metamorphic event in the case of overgrowths. As seen in the samples analysed, 
monazites commonly do not lie on the Concordia curve. This behaviour is attributed to the presence of 
excess 206Pb formed by the initial incorporation of 230Th (Heaman and Parrish, 1991). Ages obtained 
using the 40Ar-39Ar technique are not as straightforward to interpret. While a plateau age gives the age 
of a metamorphic event, in general, ages produced with the 40Ar-39Ar technique commonly generate 
problems of interpretation.  
 
In this study, ten populations of biotite, muscovite and microcline grains were analysed using the 40Ar-
39Ar technique. Out of these ten samples, three (NN75/26, NCH1 and MUS1) do not yield plateau ages 
as defined by MacDougall (1999). In this section we discuss the provisos related to the interpretation 
of these three samples. Sample NN75/26, which was collected from an iron-formation located 2 m 
below a tuffaceous layer, yielded a hump-shaped curve on an age vs %39Ar released diagram, with 
apparent ages ranging from 53.7 ± 1.0 Ma to 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma, which implies a thermal disturbance of 

--- Page 26 ---
 
22
the system (Lo and Onstott, 1989; Di Vicenzo et al., 2003). The maximum apparent ages of this 
sample are significantly older than ages yielded by other samples from this area and from this drill 
hole. The 631.8 ± 1.8 Ma apparent age is the highest recorded during this study but is difficult to 
interpret because it occurs without the presence of a plateau age. Still, this age can be found elsewhere 
in the Lufilian Arc (Cosi et al., 1992). One plausible explanation for the disturbed age spectrum 
yielded by the sample NN75/26 is the incorporation of an excess of argon in the biotite. It is difficult to 
pin-point the cause of this excess. The emplacement of the tuffaceous layer below which the sample 
was extracted cannot explain this argon excess. The temperatures involved were too low and the 
thermal effects on the surrounding rocks were minimal. Although the biotite was separated with 
extreme care in order to obtain pristine biotite, it is possible that some chloritised biotite may have 
been included in the analysed population of grains. The excess of argon may then have been associated 
with the chlorite (Lo and Onstott, 1989). Problems with the sample NCH1 from Nchanga Mine were 
purely technical and induced a partial loss of argon. It should be noted that the apparent age before the 
loss, 487.7 ± 1.3 Ma, is similar within error, to the apparent age following the lost step due to the 
technical problem, at 489.3 ± 3.1 Ma. Finally, microclines (from sample MUS1) were also analysed 
with the 40Ar-39Ar technique. This sample does not yield a plateau age but instead shows gradually 
increasing apparent ages between 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma and 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma. It is not uncommon to find these 
age spectra for potassium feldspars. These minerals do not have one closure temperature but a range of 
closure temperatures ranging from 350°C to 125°C (Foland, 1974; Purdy and Jäger, 1976; Harrison 
and McDougall, 1982; Lovera et al., 1989). A spectrum without a plateau age may imply a slow 
cooling, but it is difficult to quantify the rate at which it occurs without a complete 40Ar-39Ar study of 
K-feldspars from the area.

In the present study, Ar-Ar and U-Pb SHRIMP analyses were performed on several samples collected 
from a stratigraphic succession extending from the Lower Roan Subgroup to the Grand Conglomerat 
Formation. A summary of the ages obtained in this study is given in Table 14. The ages obtained do 
not represent a continuum but rather several distinct groupings. Three samples yielded ages between 
631.8 ± 1.8 and 592 ± 22 Ma. This age span is recorded in other parts of the Central African 
Copperbelt and in the Irumide Belt. In central Zambia a phase of eclogite facies metamorphism was 
dated at 595 ± 10 Ma, based on a Sm-Nd age on garnet and whole rock in eclogite (John et al., 2003). 
In the Zambian Copperbelt, Re-Os analyses on rocks from the Nkana, Chibuluma and Nchanga 
deposits yielded an isochron age of 583 ± 24 Ma (Barra et al., 2004). A similar, but reset, Rb-Sr age of 
582 ± 40 Ma was obtained (Cahen et al., 1984) for the Kafue Rhyolite, which has a U-Pb zircon age of 
c. 879 Ma (Hanson et al., 1994). U-Th-Pb analyses on monazites from the Luiswishi Cu-Co-U deposits 
in the Democratic Republic of Congo gave ages between 603 ± 31 Ma and 556 ± 29 Ma (Lerouge et 
al., 2004). The age of 531 ± 12 Ma obtained in this study with the U-Pb technique on metamorphic 
monazites from the Chambishi basin is similar to others found elsewhere in the Lufilian arc and the 
Zambezi Belt. Monazite from a biotite-kyanite-garnet gneiss showed an U-Pb age of 529 ± 2 Ma while 
the same minerals from some whiteschists yielded 207Pb/235U ages of 531 to 532 ± 2 Ma (John et al., 
2004). Molybdenite from the Nkana deposit yielded an age of 525.7 ± 3.4 Ma with the Re-Os 
technique (Barra et al., 2004). In central Zambia, an unfolded rhyolite in the Katangan sedimentary 
sequence was dated with the U-Pb zircon leaching technique at 538.0 ± 1.5 Ma (Hanson et al., 1993). 
Recent U-Th-Pb analyses on monazites of sediments from the Luiswishi deposit yielded an age of 556 
± 29 Ma (Lerouge et al., 2004). Analyses on monazites and rutiles from the Kalumbila deposit in 
northwest Zambia yielded U-Pb ages of 548.6 ± 7.6 Ma and 531 ± 21 Ma respectively (Steven and 
Armstrong, 2003). The age of 512 ± 17 Ma, obtained from the last set of analysed monazites 
(RCB1/36), was also found elsewhere in the Copperbelt. Richards et al. (1988a, b) analysed rutiles and 
uraninites associated with veining crosscutting the ore body of the Musoshi deposit. The ages for rutile 
and uraninite are identical with 514 ± 2 Ma and 514 ± 3 Ma. More recently, Re-Os and U-Pb analyses 
of respectively molybdenite and monazite yielded ages of 511.8 ± 1.7 Ma (molybdenite), 512.9 ± 1.7 
Ma  (molybdenite) and 509 ± 11 Ma (monazite) (Torrealday et al., 2000).  
 
The last and largest set of samples yielded the youngest age range, between 467.0 ± 2.7 Ma and 496.6 
± 0.6 Ma. Similar ages are widely recorded in the Copperbelt and adjacent areas. In the Domes area, 
west of the Zambian Copperbelt, Cosi et al. (1992) obtained a large set of K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages 
ranging from 475 ± 6 Ma to 492 ± 6 Ma. Furthermore, Cahen and Snelling (1971) obtained a K-Ar age 
of 483 ± 15 Ma for lavas located in the Kibambale area as well as K-Ar biotite ages from Nkana, 
Nchanga and Kinsenda ranging between 495 and 422 Ma.  
 
Regional implications 
 
During the Neoproterozoic, at c. 750–730 Ma, the southern part of the Congo Craton underwent rifting 
during the opening of the Khomas ocean (Hoffman, 1994). Damaran and Katangan sedimentary rocks 
were deposited in the resulting passive margin (Porada and Berhorst, 2000). During the Pan-African 
Damaran-Lufilian Orogeny, the Khomas ocean closed with subduction of oceanic lithosphere 
underneath the Congo Craton margin, leading to the formation of an Andean-type magmatic arc, and 
ultimately to the Himalayan-type collision between the Congo and Kalahari Cratons at about 550-510 
Ma (Miller, 1983; Porada and Berhorst, 2000). Eclogite facies metamorphism from the Zambezi Belt, 
dated at 595 ± 10 Ma, and comprising associated gabbros, metagabbros and eclogite, records the 
timing of the subduction, which took place in an oceanic environment (John et al., 2003).

The ages of c. 590 Ma recorded by both the U-Pb system in monazite, and the 40Ar-39Ar system in 
biotite in the present study show that there was some tectonic activity with attendant metamorphism in 
the Chambishi Basin that was coeval with the eclogite facies metamorphism recorded in the Zambezi 
Belt. The temperatures during this first metamorphic event were higher than during subsequent events, 
as recorded by the epidote-amphibolite facies assemblages at Muliashi. Talc-kyanite whiteschists in the 
Lufilian Arc, dated at c. 530 Ma, represent the final stage of collision between the Congo and the 
Kalahari Cratons (John et al., 2004). Our monazite age of 531 ± 12 Ma is probably related to this 
event. The ages at c. 512 Ma recorded in the Katangan basin are clearly related to a widespread 
mineralising phase (molybdenite, monazite, rutile, uraninite) due to circulation of fluids (Richards et 
al., 1988a,b; Torrealday et al., 2000). The range of 40Ar-39Ar mica ages at c. 492–406 Ma may be 
related to post-orogenic regional uplift and cooling which affected the whole Katangan basin. The 
youngest apparent 40Ar/39Ar ages obtained are from microcline at Musoshi and range from 467.0 ± 2.7 
Ma to 405.8 ± 3.8 Ma. This age range encompasses a muscovite Rb-Sr age of 450 ± 9 Ma from 
Malundwe in the Mwombezhi Dome (Cosi et al., 1992). This young metamorphic event corresponds to 
the age (458–427 Ma) of the late nepheline-syenite Mukumbi intrusion north of the Mwombezhi Dome 
(Cosi et al., 1992). Young intrusions of an age similar to the Mukumbi nepheline-syenite have not 
been reported from the Copperbelt region, thus it is likely that the youngest ages recorded by the 
microclines at Musoshi are a reflection of continued post-orogenic uplift and slow cooling of the 
Lufilian orogen.
